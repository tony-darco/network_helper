It is designed to facilitate secure and efficient control over network access by verifying user identities, determining their permissions, and tracking their usage. RADIUS is employed across various network environments, including enterprise Wi-Fi networks, remote access services, and other network security infrastructures. \n\nRADIUS servers serve as central points for managing user credentials and access rights, ensuring that only authorized users can connect to network resources. These servers handle authentication requests by validating user credentials, such as usernames and passwords, and then determine the level of access permitted based on predefined policies. Additionally, RADIUS manages authorization by assigning appropriate permissions and access rights to authenticated users, ensuring they can only access permitted resources. The protocol also supports accounting functions, which involve tracking user activity, session duration, and data usage for auditing, billing, or security purposes.\n\nOverall, RADIUS plays a crucial role in enterprise network security by providing a scalable and standardized method for managing user access across diverse network devices and services.
