Specifically, the IP assignment mode determines the method by which clients are assigned IP addresses, ensuring proper network configuration and communication. These modes are essential for managing network connectivity, as they influence how devices obtain their IP addresses, whether dynamically or statically. In the context of a network, understanding the IP assignment mode is crucial for network administrators to configure and troubleshoot network connectivity effectively. Overall, IP assignment modes serve as a fundamental aspect of network management, dictating the process through which clients receive IP addresses and thereby facilitating seamless network operation.\",61\n246,BRIDGE MODE,NETWORK,Bridge mode is a type of IP assignment mode,61\n247,NAT MODE,NETWORK,NAT mode is a type of IP assignment mode,61\n248,LAYER 3 ROAMING,NETWORK,Layer 3 roaming is a network feature enabling seamless mobility,61\n249,ADMIN SPLASH PAGE,NETWORK,Admin splash page is used for user login and network information,61\n250,WALLED GARDEN,NETWORK,\"A \"\"Walled Garden\"\" in the context of a network refers to a controlled environment that restricts user access to certain online resources and services prior to authentication.
