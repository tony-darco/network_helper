When users connect to a specific SSID (Service Set Identifier), the splash page is displayed to provide necessary information or to facilitate the authentication process required for network access. It functions as an intermediary page that users must interact with—often by entering credentials, accepting terms of service, or viewing important notices—before being granted full access to the internet or network resources. The primary role of a splash page is to ensure secure and controlled access to Wi-Fi networks while also delivering relevant information to users upon connection.\",12\n645,SPLASH THEME,\"The visual theme applied to the splash page, identified by a theme ID\",1\n646,LOGO,\"The entity \"\"LOGO\"\" refers to an image used for branding purposes on the splash page of a website or application. This logo is displayed prominently on the splash page to establish visual identity and brand recognition. The logo is represented as an image file that is associated with the splash page, and it is specified by its MD5 hash and file extension. The MD5 hash serves as a unique identifier for the image file, ensuring integrity and consistency in referencing the correct logo. The image file's extension indicates the format of the logo, such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF, which determines its quality and compatibility. Overall, the \"\"LOGO\"\" is a crucial visual element used to convey branding and identity on the splash page, identified and managed through its MD5 hash and file extension to ensure proper display and integrity.\",1\n651,THEME,\"A visual theme applied to the splash page, identified by 'themeId' to customize appearance\",1\n652,WELCOME MESSAGE,\"A message displayed to users on the splash page, such as \"\"Welcome!\"\"\",1\n653,SPLASH TIMEOUT,\"SPLASH TIMEOUT refers to the duration, measured in minutes, that determines how frequently users are prompted with the splash page. This setting controls the interval at which the splash page appears again for a user, based on the specified timeout period. Common options for the splash timeout include durations such as 30, 60, 120 minutes, among others. Essentially, after a user has viewed the splash page, the timeout period begins, and the splash page will not reappear until this period has elapsed. This configuration helps manage user experience by preventing the splash page from appearing too frequently while ensuring it reappears after the designated timeout period. The term \"\"splash timeout\"\" is used interchangeably with \"\"duration in minutes that determines how often users see the splash page,\"\" emphasizing its role in controlling the frequency of splash page display based on the set timeout duration.\",1\n655,USE SPLASH URL,A boolean setting indicating whether users will be redirected to a custom splash URL,1\n656,USE REDIRECT URL,A boolean setting indicating whether users will be redirected to a custom redirect URL after the splash page,1\n688,MERAKI AUTHENTICATION,EVENT,1\n654,REDIRECT URL,\"The entity \"\"REDIRECT URL\"\" refers to a specific web address designated for redirecting users following their interaction with a splash page. This URL is configured through the parameter 'redirectUrl' and serves as the destination point for users after they have viewed the splash page. When the setting 'useRedirectUrl' is enabled and set to true, users are automatically redirected to this specified URL upon completing their interaction with the splash page. In essence, the \"\"REDIRECT URL\"\" functions as the target location for user redirection post-splash page, ensuring a seamless transition to the intended webpage or resource.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n309,SPLASH PAGE,SPLASH URL,The splash page can redirect users to a custom URL,14\n310,SPLASH PAGE,SPLASH THEME,The splash page uses a specific visual theme,13\n311,SPLASH PAGE,LOGO,\"The splash page is designed to include a logo that is identified by its MD5 hash.
