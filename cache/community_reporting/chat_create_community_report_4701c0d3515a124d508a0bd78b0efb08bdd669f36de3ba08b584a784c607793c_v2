It operates within a designated band mode, which determines the frequency range used for wireless communication. The configuration of SSID 4 includes a defined minimum bitrate, ensuring a baseline data transfer rate for connected devices. These settings are tailored to optimize network performance and reliability. Overall, SSID 4's configuration encompasses its band operation mode and minimum bitrate, reflecting its role as a distinct wireless network with particular performance parameters.\",2\n18,SSID,\"The SSID, or Service Set Identifier, is a fundamental element in wireless network configurations, serving as the unique name of a wireless network broadcasted by access points. It is used by clients to identify, connect to, and distinguish between different Wi-Fi networks within a given environment. The SSID can be represented by names such as \"\"SSID 10,\"\" \"\"SSID 11,\"\" \"\"SSID 12,\"\" or \"\"SSID 13,\"\" indicating different wireless network identifiers. \n\nIn network management and security contexts, the SSID is also associated with allowlist entries, where it is identified by attributes such as ID, name, and number. The SSID plays a crucial role in filtering connection statistics and network data, enabling administrators to monitor and manage wireless network usage effectively. During security scans, such as Air Marshal scans, the SSID is detected as the name of the Wi-Fi network, further emphasizing its role in network identification.\n\nFrom a configuration perspective, the SSID is used in various settings, including API query parameters to filter results by specific SSID numbers. It is also involved in defining minimum bitrate options for wireless networks, where the setting can specify whether the minimum bitrate applies to the 'band' or the 'ssid' itself, with the default being 'band.' Additionally, the selection of band can be set to either 'ssid' or 'ap' (access point), and this parameter is required during network creation.\n\nOverall, the SSID is a critical identifier in wireless networking, serving both as a broadcasted network name and as a key parameter in network configuration, security, and management processes.\",9\n50,ACCESS POINT,\"An access point is a hardware device that plays a crucial role in extending and managing wireless network coverage within a network infrastructure.
