Its product portfolio includes wireless access points, switches, security appliances, and management dashboards, all of which are managed via cloud-based platforms. Meraki's solutions focus on providing secure, reliable, and scalable network infrastructure, with features such as traffic shaping, network device management, and security services. The company also emphasizes mobile device management and incorporates Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to support various IoT and location-based applications. Overall, Meraki is dedicated to delivering integrated, cloud-managed networking hardware and software solutions that facilitate efficient network management, security, and connectivity for organizations of all sizes.\",11\n148,GEO,\"The entity \"\"GEO\"\" pertains to geographical entities, including countries, cities, or regions, that are referenced within network configurations or security settings. The descriptions indicate that \"\"GEO\"\" is associated with geographic locations in a broad sense, often through indirect references such as network infrastructure, paths, descriptions, or schema fields. However, none of the provided texts explicitly mention specific geographic entities by name. Instead, they suggest that geographic locations are implied or referenced indirectly through contextual clues like network paths, organizational references, or infrastructure descriptions. Some descriptions note that the text references geographic locations such as \"\"organization,\"\" \"\"network,\"\" \"\"city,\"\" \"\"path,\"\" \"\"description,\"\" \"\"schema,\"\" and \"\"example,\"\" but these are not explicitly identified as specific places. Overall, \"\"GEO\"\" encompasses a range of geographic entities that are relevant to network and security configurations, primarily implied through contextual references rather than explicit naming.\",4\n615,IDENTITY PSK,\"The \"\"IDENTITY PSK\"\" refers to a network security key used for client authentication in wireless networks. It is a pre-shared key (PSK) that serves as a fundamental component in securing wireless communications by authenticating devices attempting to connect to the network. The \"\"IDENTITY PSK\"\" is represented as a string that functions as a pre-shared key within wireless network configurations, ensuring that only authorized devices can access the network resources. \n\nIn addition to its role as an authentication credential, the \"\"IDENTITY PSK\"\" is associated with various metadata, such as expiration dates and related network details, which help manage and maintain the security and integrity of the wireless network. This metadata ensures that the key remains valid and secure over time, and it facilitates network administrators in monitoring and updating security credentials as needed.\n\nOverall, the \"\"IDENTITY PSK\"\" is a critical security element in wireless network infrastructure, providing a shared secret that authenticates client devices and helps prevent unauthorized access. Its use of a pre-shared key simplifies the authentication process while maintaining a secure environment, especially in small to medium-sized networks where centralized authentication servers may not be employed.\",3\n622,SYSTEM'S MANAGER USER,\"A user responsible for managing the Meraki system, associated with email miles@meraki.com\",1\n686,SENTRY,\"Sentry is a security system or service related to network enforcement, possibly used for monitoring or controlling access within Meraki's network solutions.\",1\n687,MERAKI DASHBOARD,\"Meraki Dashboard is the cloud-based management platform that allows administrators to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot Meraki network devices and services.\",1\n700,MERAKI:LAYER7,\"Layer 7 refers to application-layer features in Meraki's network management suite\nMeraki's Layer 7 refers to application-layer traffic management features within Meraki's network solutions\",1\n699,TRAFFICSHAPING,\"Traffic shaping involves rules and policies to control network bandwidth and prioritize traffic\nTraffic shaping is a network management technique used to control the bandwidth and prioritize network traffic, often implemented by organizations to optimize network performance\",3\n588,APPLICATION,\"The software or system that manages or applies the wireless configuration settings, such as EAP override parameters\nThe software or system that manages or applies the wireless configuration settings, such as EAP override parameters)<|COMPLETE|>\",6\n711,TRAFFIC SHAPING RULES,\"The traffic shaping rules define how network traffic is managed, including definitions, bandwidth limits, and tagging options\",3\n409,HOST,\"The entity referred to as \"\"HOST\"\" is a person who serves as a host.
