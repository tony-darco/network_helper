It is used for filtering connection and latency data, and encompasses details such as the network name, authentication mode (e.g., 802.1x-radius), encryption mode (e.g., WPA-EAP), and pre-shared key, which collectively determine the security and access parameters for wireless profiles. The SSID also includes configurable properties like minimum bitrate, band operation mode, enabled bands, and band steering status, reflecting different wireless network configurations. It is used to establish wireless connections for devices such as cameras and other networked equipment, ensuring proper authentication and security. Overall, the SSID functions as a crucial identifier for managing, configuring, and analyzing wireless networks within the environment.\",49\n76,AUTH MODE,\"The \"\"AUTH MODE\"\" entity refers to the authentication method configured for a wireless network SSID. It specifies how clients authenticate to the network, with common methods including \"\"psk\"\" (pre-shared key), \"\"8021x-radius\"\" (IEEE 802.1X with RADIUS server), \"\"open\"\" (no authentication), and \"\"8021x-entra\"\" (a variant of 802.1X authentication). This setting determines the process by which users and devices verify their identity when connecting to the wireless network, thereby influencing the network's security and access control mechanisms.\",1\n74,ENCRYPTION MODE,\"The \"\"ENCRYPTION MODE\"\" refers to the security protocol employed by a wireless network's SSID to safeguard data transmissions. It specifies the encryption type used, such as WEP, WPA, WPA-PSK, or WPA-EAP, which determines how wireless data is protected and ensures data confidentiality during transmission. This setting defines the security encryption method applied in the wireless profile, directly impacting the level of data security and confidentiality for wireless communications.\",1\n73,AUTHENTICATION MODE,\"The \"\"AUTHENTICATION MODE\"\" refers to the method used to verify user identities for access to a wireless network's SSID, significantly impacting the network's security level. It encompasses various authentication techniques such as open authentication, shared key, and more secure protocols like 802.1X, which often employs RADIUS servers, or pre-shared keys (PSK). This mode determines the security protocol employed—examples include 802.1X with RADIUS or PSK—thereby defining how devices authenticate themselves to access the network and establishing the access control mechanisms in place.\",1\n338,SSID ADMIN,\"The administrator responsible for managing and configuring a specific SSID, including security settings and access policies\",1\n339,MANDATORY DHCP ENABLED,\"\"\"MANDATORY DHCP ENABLED\"\" is a boolean setting that enforces clients connecting to a specific SSID to use IP addresses assigned exclusively by the DHCP server. This configuration ensures that all devices must obtain their IP addresses dynamically through DHCP, thereby standardizing network access control and simplifying IP management within the wireless network environment. By enabling this setting, the network mandates that clients cannot use static IP addresses and must rely on DHCP for network connectivity, which enhances security, simplifies troubleshooting, and maintains consistent network policies across connected devices.\",1\n368,BAND SELECTION,\"\"\"Band Selection\"\" refers to the configuration setting that determines which radio frequency band(s) a wireless network or SSID operates on, significantly impacting device connectivity, wireless performance, and client distribution. It specifies whether the network uses a single band, such as \"\"5 GHz only,\"\" or multiple bands, such as \"\"Dual band operation\"\" or \"\"Dual band with Band Steering.\"\" These settings influence how client devices connect to the network, optimize load balancing across frequency bands, and enhance overall wireless efficiency. The configuration of band selection is crucial for managing radio frequency usage and ensuring optimal wireless network performance.\",1\n369,PER CLIENT BANDWIDTH LIMIT UP,\"The entity \"\"PER CLIENT BANDWIDTH LIMIT UP\"\" refers to a network management setting that controls the maximum upload bandwidth allocated to each client device connected to a specific SSID. This setting is used to prevent network congestion by regulating individual client upload speeds, thereby optimizing overall network performance. The limit is typically defined in kilobits per second (Kbps), with a value of 0 indicating no upload bandwidth restriction for the client. This configuration ensures fair distribution of upload resources among clients and maintains stable network operation.\",1\n376,PER CLIENT BANDWIDTH LIMIT DOWN,\"\"\"PER CLIENT BANDWIDTH LIMIT DOWN\"\" refers to the bandwidth restriction applied to individual client devices for downstream data transfer. This setting controls the maximum download speeds that each client can achieve on a specific SSID, measured in kilobits per second (Kbps). The purpose of this limit is to ensure fair resource distribution among multiple users by preventing any single client from consuming excessive download bandwidth. A value of 0 indicates that there is no limit imposed on the client's download speed, allowing unrestricted data transfer.

When this indicator is true, the SSID is broadcast on all access points, ensuring maximum coverage and accessibility throughout the network environment. Conversely, if the indicator is false, the SSID's broadcast is limited and controlled by availability tags, which restrict its visibility to specific access points. This setting allows network administrators to manage SSID coverage strategically, either providing broad access or segmenting network access based on organizational or security requirements.\",1\n382,AVAILABILITY TAGS,\"\"\"AVAILABILITY TAGS\"\" are a set of tags associated with SSIDs that are used to control their broadcast to specific access points. These tags enable administrators to restrict SSID visibility by matching them with access point tags, allowing for selective deployment and broadcast of SSIDs across different access points.

This URL serves as an authentication portal or informational display, allowing administrators to manage user access and provide necessary information. It functions as the administrator's designated splash page for login or informational purposes, ensuring controlled and secure entry to the network environment.\",1\n360,WALLED GARDEN ENABLED,\"\"\"WALLED GARDEN ENABLED\"\" is a boolean setting that allows for controlled pre-authentication access within a wireless network environment. When enabled, it permits users to access specific IP ranges, domains, or wildcards prior to signing on, thereby enhancing initial access control and providing a limited, managed environment for users before they authenticate. This feature facilitates a secure and streamlined onboarding process by enabling access to a configurable list of network resources, ensuring that users can reach essential services or information without compromising overall network security.\",1\n361,WALLED GARDEN RANGES,\"The \"\"WALLED GARDEN RANGES\"\" refers to a collection of IP addresses, CIDR ranges, domain names, or wildcards that define the scope of pre-authentication access within a network's walled garden environment. These ranges specify the limited set of resources, including specific IP address ranges and domain names, that are accessible to users before they authenticate. This configuration allows for controlled and restricted access to certain network resources, enabling users to access essential services or information without full network authentication. The purpose of these ranges is to establish a secure and manageable pre-authentication access zone, ensuring that users can reach designated resources while maintaining overall network security.\",1\n411,VISIBILITY,\"Whether the SSID is advertised or hidden, affecting discoverability by clients\"\"\",1\n436,HOTSPOT 2.0 SETTINGS,\"Configuration parameters for Hotspot 2.0, including whether it is enabled, operator information, venue details, network access type, allowed domains, roam consortia, MCC/MNC codes, and NAI realms, used to manage Wi-Fi hotspot access and authentication\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n54,SSID,WIRELESS PROFILE,\"Associates a wireless profile with specific SSID configurations, defining how the network appears and authenticates\",56\n55,SSID,AUTH MODE,\"Defines the authentication method used by the SSID, affecting security and credential requirements\",50\n56,SSID,ENCRYPTION MODE,\"The \"\"SSID\"\" (Service Set Identifier) is a network name used to identify a wireless local area network (WLAN).
