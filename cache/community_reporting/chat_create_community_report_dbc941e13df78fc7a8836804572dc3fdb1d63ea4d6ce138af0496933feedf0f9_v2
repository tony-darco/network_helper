The configurations for SSID 4 include parameters such as the band operation mode and minimum bitrate, which are tailored to meet the network's performance and security requirements. These settings ensure that SSID 4 operates efficiently within the wireless infrastructure, providing reliable connectivity for authorized devices. Overall, SSID 4 is an integral part of the office's wireless network setup, with carefully defined parameters to optimize network performance and security.\",3\n40,SSID,\"The SSID, or Service Set Identifier, is a fundamental component in wireless network configurations, serving as the unique name assigned to a wireless network. It is broadcasted by wireless access points to enable devices to identify and connect to the specific network. The SSID functions as a network identifier, distinguishing one wireless network from another within a given environment or system. It can be associated with various network settings and configurations, including security parameters, splash page settings, outage schedules, and traffic shaping rules.\n\nIn practical applications, the SSID is used to manage and organize wireless networks within an organization. It allows network administrators to specify minimum bitrate options, which can be set either by the SSID itself or by the broader network band, with the default being the band. Band selection can be configured to either 'ssid' or 'ap' (access point), and this parameter is required during network creation. The SSID also plays a role in filtering results via API query parameters, such as filtering by SSID number.\n\nFurthermore, the SSID is integral to network security and management. It is associated with specific security settings, including EAP parameters, and can be part of allowlist entries identified by ID, name, and number. The SSID is also used in traffic management, where traffic shaping rules can be applied to specific wireless networks identified by their SSID. Additionally, outage schedules can be configured or listed for particular SSIDs, enabling controlled access during designated times.\n\nWithin device environments, the SSID helps distinguish different wireless networks, facilitating device connections and network management. It is also used in network splash page settings, which are often employed for user authentication or informational purposes when connecting to the network.\n\nOverall, the SSID is a critical identifier in wireless networking, representing the network name broadcasted by access points, used for device connection, network management, security configuration, and traffic control.

Additionally, SSID 13 operates within a specified band mode, which determines the frequency band (such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) used for wireless communication. These settings collectively optimize the network's performance, security, and compatibility with various client devices. The configuration details suggest that SSID 13 is tailored to meet particular operational requirements, ensuring reliable connectivity and efficient data transfer within its designated environment.\",1\n252,BANDSTEERINGENABLED,\"BANDSTEERINGENABLED is a boolean setting that indicates whether the band steering feature is activated for a specific network or SSID. When this setting is enabled (true), it automatically directs clients to connect to the most open or optimal wireless band between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The primary purpose of this feature is to optimize client connections by balancing the load across both frequency bands, thereby enhancing overall network performance and reliability. \n\nThis setting is applicable on a per-SSID basis, allowing network administrators to enable or disable band steering for individual wireless networks as needed. When enabled, the feature intelligently guides clients to the less congested or more suitable band, improving connection quality and reducing interference. Conversely, if disabled (false), clients connect to bands without automatic guidance, which may lead to suboptimal distribution and potential network congestion.\n\nIn summary, BANDSTEERINGENABLED is a crucial configuration option that, when activated, helps ensure efficient utilization of wireless spectrum by steering clients to the most appropriate band, thereby optimizing network performance and user experience.\",1\n254,SSID 5,\"SSID 5 is an entity that is classified as an organization.

It utilizes the RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) protocol to ensure that authentication processes are conducted securely and efficiently. As a RADSEC SERVER, it plays a critical role in managing network access by verifying user credentials and authorizations, thereby maintaining the integrity and security of the network. The server's primary function is to enable secure RADIUS communications, which involves encrypting and protecting authentication data transmitted across the network. This ensures that sensitive information, such as user credentials, remains confidential and protected from potential threats. The RADSEC SERVER is integral to modern network security architectures, providing a reliable and secure means of managing user access and authentication across various network devices and services. Its deployment enhances overall network security by leveraging the robust security features of the RADIUS protocol, combined with the added security of secure transport mechanisms inherent in RADSEC (RADIUS over TLS).
