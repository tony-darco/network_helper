It specifies the width of the wireless channel in megahertz (MHz), with options such as 'auto', 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz. These settings influence data transfer rates, throughput, and interference levels. A wider channel (e.g., 80 MHz or 160 MHz) generally allows for higher data rates but may increase interference, while narrower channels (e.g., 20 MHz) tend to be more resistant to interference but offer lower throughput. The configuration of channel width is crucial for optimizing wireless network performance and is adjustable based on network requirements and environmental conditions.\",3\n265,FIVE GHZ SETTINGS,\"Configuration parameters specific to the 5 GHz wireless band, including power levels, minimum bitrate, auto channels, channel width, and RX-SOP sensitivity\",7\n267,ALL BANDS,,9\n258,TWO FOUR GHZ SETTINGS,\"The \"\"TWO FOUR GHZ SETTINGS\"\" refer to configuration options specific to the 2.4 GHz wireless band, which influence the coverage and performance of the 2.4 GHz network segment. These settings include parameters such as maximum power levels, minimum bitrate, auto channel selection, and radio features like Wi-Fi 6 (ax) support and RX-SOP sensitivity. These configurations are essential for optimizing wireless communication within the 2.4 GHz frequency, ensuring effective coverage, stability, and compatibility with various devices.\",5\n266,SIX GHZ SETTINGS,\"Configuration parameters specific to the 6 GHz wireless band, including power levels, minimum bitrate, and other band-specific settings\",4\n272,MAX POWER,,4\n268,MIN POWER,\"\"\"MIN POWER\"\" refers to the minimum transmission power level, measured in decibels-milliwatts (dBm), for wireless radios within a specific wireless band. This setting is adjustable within a range (e.g., 2 to 30 dBm) and directly influences the signal strength, coverage area, and potential interference of the wireless interface. By configuring the minimum transmission power, network administrators can optimize coverage and minimize interference, ensuring efficient and reliable wireless communication.\",4\n233,RX-SOP,\"The \"\"RX-SOP\"\" refers to the receive sensitivity level of a radio in wireless communication systems. It is a configurable parameter that determines the radio's sensitivity to incoming signals, with adjustable settings typically ranging from -65 dBm to -95 dBm. Adjusting this sensitivity impacts the radio's performance, with more negative values indicating higher sensitivity. Proper configuration of RX-SOP is crucial for optimal radio operation and performance, and it is recommended that such adjustments be made under the guidance of an expert to ensure effective network performance.\",2\n269,VALID AUTO CHANNELS,\"\"\"VALID AUTO CHANNELS\"\" refers to a list of channels that are automatically selected for wireless communication interfaces to ensure optimal performance and minimal interference. These channels are specific to each frequency band, such as 1, 6, and 11 for the 2.4 GHz band, and a set of appropriate channels for the 5 GHz band. The list of valid auto-selectable channels helps in controlling the auto channel selection process, enabling the wireless system to choose the most suitable frequencies dynamically for each band, thereby enhancing network reliability and efficiency.\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n178,SSID,CHANNEL WIDTH,\"Each SSID can have a specified channel width, affecting bandwidth and data rates\",52\n239,FIVE GHZ SETTINGS,ALL BANDS,\"The overall settings for all bands include specific configurations for the 5 GHz band, affecting its power, bitrate, channels, and radio features\nThe 5 GHz band settings are part of the overall all bands configuration, influencing its power, channels, and radio features\",16\n234,TWO FOUR GHZ SETTINGS,ALL BANDS,\"The 2.4 GHz band settings are part of the overall all bands configuration, influencing its power, channels, and radio features\nThe overall settings for all bands include specific configurations for the 2.4 GHz band, affecting its power, bitrate, and radio features\",14\n246,SIX GHZ SETTINGS,ALL BANDS,\"The overall settings for all bands include specific configurations for the 6 GHz band, affecting its power, bitrate, and other features\nThe 6 GHz band settings are part of the overall all bands configuration, influencing its power, channels, and radio features\",13\n250,ALL BANDS,MAX POWER,\"The maximum power setting applies to all bands, influencing their transmission strength\",13\n235,TWO FOUR GHZ SETTINGS,MAX POWER,\"Specific to 2.4 GHz, controlling its transmission power\",9\n236,TWO FOUR GHZ SETTINGS,MIN POWER,\"Specific to 2.4 GHz, controlling its minimum transmission power\",9\n245,FIVE GHZ SETTINGS,RX-SOP,\"RX-SOP level for 5 GHz, influencing radio sensitivity\",9\n238,TWO FOUR GHZ SETTINGS,VALID AUTO CHANNELS,\"Auto channels for 2.4 GHz, such as [1, 6, 11], guiding auto channel selection\",8\n\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}, "key": "chat_create_community_report_95c7afaa086f9d9e90f7499f4a76ed5ccff379d0eccf6d7ab41e80fa0152d954_v2"}
