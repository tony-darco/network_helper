It influences the radio band usage of the SSID, determining whether it operates on a particular frequency band such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz. This selection affects the frequency characteristics and performance performance of the SSID, impacting factors like coverage, data throughput, and interference management. By configuring the band selection, network administrators can optimize wireless performance and ensure appropriate frequency utilization for the SSID within the wireless network environment.\",50\n355,SSID,PER CLIENT BANDWIDTH LIMIT UP,Controls individual client upload speeds for the SSID,50\n356,SSID,PER CLIENT BANDWIDTH LIMIT DOWN,Controls individual client download speeds for the SSID,50\n357,SSID,PER SSID BANDWIDTH LIMIT UP,Sets overall upload capacity for the SSID,50\n358,SSID,PER SSID BANDWIDTH LIMIT DOWN,Sets overall download capacity for the SSID,50\n359,SSID,LAN ISOLATION ENABLED,Enables or disables LAN-level client isolation for the SSID,50\n360,SSID,VISIBLE,Determines if the SSID is broadcasted or hidden,50\n361,SSID,AVAILABLE ON ALL APS,Specifies if all access points broadcast the SSID or if it is restricted,50\n362,SSID,AVAILABILITY TAGS,\"The SSID (Service Set Identifier) is associated with AVAILABILITY TAGS, which are used to control and restrict the broadcast of the SSID across access points (APs). These tags determine on which APs the SSID is available by matching specific tag criteria, thereby enabling network administrators to selectively enable or disable SSID visibility on particular access points. This mechanism allows for targeted network access management, ensuring that the SSID is only broadcast on designated APs based on the assigned tags.\",50\n364,SSID,ADULT CONTENT FILTERING ENABLED,Activates content filtering for the SSID,50\n365,SSID,DNS REWRITE,Configures DNS rewriting settings for the SSID,50\n366,SSID,SPEED BURST,Controls temporary bandwidth exceeding capabilities,50\n383,RADIUS AUTHENTICATION,SSID,\"The SSID uses RADIUS for authentication, which can be enabled or disabled\",50\n388,ADMIN SPLASH URL,SSID,\"The SSID can have a URL for the admin splash page, providing user access or information\",50\n390,WALLED GARDEN ENABLED,SSID,The SSID can enable a walled garden mode for limited pre-authentication access,50\n391,WALLED GARDEN RANGES,SSID,The SSID can specify IP ranges and domains accessible in walled garden mode,50\n394,SSID,VISIBILITY,Visibility setting affects whether the SSID is broadcast or hidden,50\n406,SSID,HOTSPOT 2.0 SETTINGS,\"Each SSID can have associated Hotspot 2.0 settings that control Wi-Fi hotspot features and access policies\nHotspot 2.0 settings are configured per SSID to manage Wi-Fi hotspot access and authentication\",50\n80,ALTERNATE MANAGEMENT INTERFACE,ACCESS POINT,Access points are configured with specific IP addresses and network settings for the alternate management interface,20\n82,ACCESS POINT,IP ASSIGNMENT,\"Each access point has a specific static IP assignment, including subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers, for network management\",18\n349,AP TAGS,ACCESS POINT,\"AP tags are used for identification, management, and VLAN tagging purposes\",18\n485,ACCESS POINT,ACCESS POINT TAG,\"An access point can have multiple tags for policy, site, and RF classification\",18\n486,ACCESS POINT,ACCESS POINT DETAILS,An access point has detailed specifications and attributes stored in its details,18\n487,ACCESS POINT,RECALCULATE CHANNELS,\"Recalculating channels involves adjusting the radio channels of access points to optimize performance, affecting connectivity temporarily\",18\n497,ACCESS POINT,CONTROLLER,\"Access points are managed and controlled by wireless LAN controllers, which configure and monitor their operation\",18\n495,CLIENT DEVICE,STAKEHOLDER,Stakeholders analyze client device data to assess network usage and troubleshoot issues,11\n57,IDENTITY,WIRELESS PROFILE,Links the wireless profile to specific user credentials required for authentication in 802.1x-radius mode,9\n368,NAMED VLANS,TAGGING,Indicates whether traffic should be directed to specific VLANs based on tags,5\n369,NAMED VLANS,DEFAULT VLAN NAME,Specifies the default VLAN name for traffic tagging,5\n370,NAMED VLANS,BY AP TAGS,Associates VLAN names with specific AP tags for traffic segmentation,5\n458,ACCESS POINT NETWORK,ACCESS POINT SERIAL,Each access point device belongs to a specific network identified by its network ID,5\n46,CAMERA WIRELESS PROFILE,CREATE,The API endpoint facilitates creation of new camera wireless profiles with specified settings,4\n81,ALTERNATE MANAGEMENT INTERFACE,PROTOCOLS,\"Protocols such as 'radius', 'snmp', 'syslog', and 'ldap' are used for managing and communicating with devices via the alternate management interface\",4\n374,SERVER CA CERTIFICATE,SECURITY,The server CA certificate is used to verify the server's identity during TLS/SSL connections,4\n375,CERTIFICATE,SECURITY,\"The certificate data is used to establish secure, encrypted communication channels between clients and servers\",4\n459,ACCESS POINT SERIAL,CLIENT COUNT,\"The client count is associated with a specific access point device, reflecting its current usage\",4\n\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}, "key": "chat_create_community_report_e888f70d34b0c9b0be1031147a231403e3f7d717b86d2245479fb4dee4deca41_v2"}
