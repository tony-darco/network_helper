It is identified by a VLAN ID, which serves as a unique identifier for each virtual network segment. VLANs are commonly implemented on network devices such as switches and routers to create separate broadcast domains, thereby improving network efficiency, security, and management. \n\nVLANs are utilized in various networking configurations, including the setup of Bonjour forwarding rules, where they help control and direct traffic between different segments. The primary purpose of VLANs is to segment network traffic within a network, allowing for logical separation of different groups of clients or devices without requiring physical separation. This segmentation enhances security by isolating sensitive data and reduces broadcast traffic, leading to improved network performance.\n\nThe term \"\"VLAN\"\" is a technical concept related solely to network infrastructure and does not refer to any specific organization, person, geographical location, or event.
