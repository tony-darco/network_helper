These statistics encompass various metrics that collectively provide insights into the quality and stability of network connections. Specifically, connection statistics include information about signal strength, which indicates the quality of the wireless link between the device and the access point, as well as connection duration, reflecting how long a device remains connected to the network. Band usage metrics are also included, showing which frequency bands (such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) are utilized during the connection, thereby offering insights into network load and performance.\n\nFurthermore, connection statistics cover key connection attributes such as association and authentication processes, which are essential steps in establishing a secure and functional connection between a client device and the network. The data also includes details about DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) processes, which are responsible for assigning IP addresses to devices upon connection, ensuring proper network communication. Success rates for these various processes—association, authentication, DHCP—are also recorded, providing an overall measure of connection reliability and stability.\n\nIn summary, \"\"CONNECTION STATS\"\" serve as a vital tool for analyzing the performance and reliability of wireless network connections. They aggregate data on signal quality, connection duration, band usage, and the success rates of critical connection procedures such as association, authentication, and DHCP. This comprehensive data helps network administrators monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize wireless network performance, ensuring efficient and stable connectivity for all clients on the network.\",6\n135,ASSOC,\"The entity \"\"ASSOC\"\" pertains to events related to client devices connecting to a wireless network. Specifically, it encompasses instances where a client has successfully associated with the network, including detailed connection information that confirms a successful connection. These association events serve as indicators of when a client device has successfully established a connection to the wireless infrastructure. Additionally, the term \"\"ASSOC\"\" also encompasses data regarding failed association attempts, such as the number of failed attempts for a specific device, exemplified by device Q234-ABCD-5678. This information provides insight into connectivity issues or potential problems with specific devices attempting to connect to the network. Overall, \"\"ASSOC\"\" covers both successful connection events and failed attempts, offering a comprehensive view of client association activity within the wireless network environment.\",2\n136,AUTH,\"The entity \"\"AUTH\"\" pertains to authentication events within a network. It encompasses successful client authentication processes, indicating instances where a client has successfully verified their identity and gained access to the network. These successful authentication events are critical for monitoring authorized access and ensuring network security. Additionally, the term \"\"AUTH\"\" also includes data related to failed authentication attempts, such as the number of unsuccessful login attempts for specific devices. For example, there is a record of failed authentication attempts for the device identified as Q234-ABCD-5678. Monitoring both successful and failed authentication events provides a comprehensive view of network access activity, helping to identify potential security threats, unauthorized access attempts, or issues with user credentials. Overall, \"\"AUTH\"\" serves as a key metric for assessing the security and integrity of network access, tracking both successful authentications and failed attempts to maintain a secure and well-monitored network environment.\",2\n137,DHCP,\"DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks. It facilitates the assignment of IP addresses and manages lease durations for clients, ensuring efficient and dynamic network configuration. An event related to DHCP typically indicates a process such as IP address assignment or renewal for a client device. Monitoring DHCP events is essential for maintaining network stability and troubleshooting connectivity issues. For example, tracking the number of failed DHCP attempts for a specific device, such as device Q234-ABCD-5678, can help identify potential network configuration problems or device malfunctions. Overall, DHCP plays a critical role in managing network addresses dynamically, reducing manual configuration efforts, and ensuring devices can connect seamlessly to the network.\",2\n138,SUCCESS,\"Success events denote successful network operations or connections\nAn event indicating successful connection or operation within the network\",1\n226,FAILED CONNECTION EVENTS,\"Instances where client devices failed to connect to the network, recorded with details such as timestamp and failure step\",6\n227,CLIENT MAC,Unique identifier (MAC address) of a client device attempting to connect to the network,1\n179,DNS,Number of failed DNS attempts for device Q234-ABCD-5678,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n85,CONNECTION STATS,ASSOC,Assoc events are part of connection stats indicating client association,8\n86,CONNECTION STATS,AUTH,Auth events are part of connection stats indicating successful authentication,8\n87,CONNECTION STATS,DHCP,DHCP events are part of connection stats indicating IP address assignment,8\n88,CONNECTION STATS,SUCCESS,Success events indicate successful network operations,7\n122,FAILED CONNECTION EVENTS,CLIENT MAC,Client MAC addresses are involved in the failed connection events,7\n123,FAILED CONNECTION EVENTS,DNS,DNS failure is one of the failure steps recorded during client onboarding,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
