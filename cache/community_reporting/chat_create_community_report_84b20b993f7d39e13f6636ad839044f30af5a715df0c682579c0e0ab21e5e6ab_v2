It is broadcasted by wireless access points to enable devices to identify and connect to the specific network. The SSID functions as a network identifier, distinguishing one wireless network from another within a given environment or system. It can be associated with various network settings and configurations, including security parameters, splash page settings, outage schedules, and traffic shaping rules.\n\nIn practical applications, the SSID is used to manage and organize wireless networks within an organization. It allows network administrators to specify minimum bitrate options, which can be set either by the SSID itself or by the broader network band, with the default being the band. Band selection can be configured to either 'ssid' or 'ap' (access point), and this parameter is required during network creation. The SSID also plays a role in filtering results via API query parameters, such as filtering by SSID number.\n\nFurthermore, the SSID is integral to network security and management. It is associated with specific security settings, including EAP parameters, and can be part of allowlist entries identified by ID, name, and number. The SSID is also used in traffic management, where traffic shaping rules can be applied to specific wireless networks identified by their SSID. Additionally, outage schedules can be configured or listed for particular SSIDs, enabling controlled access during designated times.\n\nWithin device environments, the SSID helps distinguish different wireless networks, facilitating device connections and network management. It is also used in network splash page settings, which are often employed for user authentication or informational purposes when connecting to the network.\n\nOverall, the SSID is a critical identifier in wireless networking, representing the network name broadcasted by access points, used for device connection, network management, security configuration, and traffic control. It is a key element in organizing and maintaining wireless network infrastructure, ensuring that devices can reliably identify and connect to the correct network within complex organizational environments.\",11\n252,BANDSTEERINGENABLED,\"BANDSTEERINGENABLED is a boolean setting that indicates whether the band steering feature is activated for a specific network or SSID. When this setting is enabled (true), it automatically directs clients to connect to the most open or optimal wireless band between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The primary purpose of this feature is to optimize client connections by balancing the load across both frequency bands, thereby enhancing overall network performance and reliability. \n\nThis setting is applicable on a per-SSID basis, allowing network administrators to enable or disable band steering for individual wireless networks as needed. When enabled, the feature intelligently guides clients to the less congested or more suitable band, improving connection quality and reducing interference. Conversely, if disabled (false), clients connect to bands without automatic guidance, which may lead to suboptimal distribution and potential network congestion.\n\nIn summary, BANDSTEERINGENABLED is a crucial configuration option that, when activated, helps ensure efficient utilization of wireless spectrum by steering clients to the most appropriate band, thereby optimizing network performance and user experience.\",1\n45,WIRELESS PROFILE A,organization,5\n54,IDENTITY,,1\n633,OUTAGE,\"A scheduled period during which the wireless network SSID is unavailable, with specified start and end times\",3\n634,SUNDAY,A day of the week used as a reference point for outage timing in seconds since midnight,1\n635,TUESDAY,A day of the week used as a reference point for outage timing in seconds since midnight,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n25,SSID,ACCESS POINT,Access points broadcast SSIDs to identify wireless networks,18\n179,SSID,BANDSTEERINGENABLED,The band steering feature is enabled or disabled for a specific SSID to optimize client connections,12\n29,WIRELESS PROFILE A,IDENTITY,\"Wireless Profile A is a network configuration profile that includes the necessary identity credentials for authentication purposes.
