Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n196,LATENCY,\"Latency refers to the measure of delay experienced in a network, specifically indicating the time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination. In the context of network performance, latency is typically expressed in milliseconds and is a critical metric for assessing the responsiveness and efficiency of a network. The term \"\"latency\"\" encompasses both wired and wireless networks, with particular emphasis on wireless environments where latency can significantly impact user experience. \n\nThe data provided indicates that latency is measured as the average value over a specified timespan, which can be segmented by various parameters such as band, SSID (Service Set Identifier), or VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network). These measurements help in understanding the performance characteristics of different segments of the network, allowing administrators to identify potential bottlenecks or areas requiring optimization. \n\nSpecifically, the average wireless latency is monitored over time to analyze network performance, providing insights into how quickly data packets are transmitted within wireless networks. This information is vital for diagnosing issues related to network responsiveness, especially in environments where real-time data transmission is critical, such as voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing, or online gaming. \n\nOverall, latency serves as a key indicator of network health, with lower latency values generally correlating with better performance and higher user satisfaction. By continuously measuring and analyzing average latency across various network segments and timeframes, network administrators can ensure optimal operation, troubleshoot issues effectively, and enhance the overall quality of service provided by the network infrastructure.\",2\n124,EVENT,\"The entity \"\"EVENT\"\" encompasses a broad range of occurrences within a network environment, serving as a fundamental component in network monitoring, management, and security processes. An event, in this context, is a recorded instance that captures significant activities or issues occurring within the network infrastructure. These events are characterized by various attributes, including timestamp, type, severity, duration, channel, RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), and additional data relevant to the specific incident or activity.\n\nNetwork-related events include detailed records of network activity and issues, such as power mode changes and CPU load history, which reflect device activity and performance over time. These events provide insights into device behavior, operational status, and resource utilization, aiding in performance optimization and troubleshooting.\n\nMonitoring network performance is also represented through events, such as packet loss analysis, which helps identify network degradation or failures. These events are crucial for maintaining network reliability and security, enabling administrators to detect anomalies, diagnose problems, and implement corrective measures promptly.\n\nAdditionally, network management activities generate events related to configuration processes, including API schema interactions and setup activities. These configuration events document changes and updates within the network infrastructure, ensuring proper documentation and facilitating troubleshooting and future modifications.\n\nWhile the provided data does not specify individual discrete events explicitly, it indicates that network monitoring and management are ongoing activities characterized by continuous event recording. These events collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of network health, security, and performance.\n\nIn summary, \"\"EVENT\"\" in this context refers to a wide array of recorded occurrences within a network environment, encompassing device activity logs, performance metrics, security-related incidents, and configuration changes. These events are essential for effective network management, troubleshooting, and security assurance, providing a detailed and structured record of network operations over time.\",5\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n131,LATENCY,EVENT,Latency measurements are recorded as events,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
