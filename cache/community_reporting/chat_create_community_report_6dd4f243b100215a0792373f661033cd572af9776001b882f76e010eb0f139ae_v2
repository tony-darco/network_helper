Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n20,BAND,\"The entity \"\"BAND\"\" pertains to the frequency ranges used in wireless communication systems. It primarily refers to the specific radio frequency bands—namely 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz—that wireless devices utilize for data transmission. These frequency bands are fundamental in wireless network configurations and influence connection quality, speed, and overall network performance.\n\nIn network settings, \"\"band\"\" is used as a parameter to specify or filter wireless data. For example, it can be employed in API queries to filter wireless usage data by the selected frequency band, allowing for targeted analysis of network performance across different bands. The common bands used are 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz, each offering distinct advantages and characteristics. The 2.4 GHz band provides broader coverage but may be more susceptible to interference, while the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands offer higher speeds and less congestion but with reduced range.\n\nAdditionally, \"\"band\"\" is associated with network configuration options, such as setting minimum bitrate thresholds. In this context, the minimum bitrate can be specified either by the \"\"band\"\" or by the \"\"ssid\"\" (Service Set Identifier), with \"\"band\"\" being the default setting. This configuration helps optimize network performance by ensuring devices operate within desired bandwidth parameters based on their frequency band.\n\nOverall, the \"\"BAND\"\" entity is integral to wireless network management, enabling the specification, filtering, and optimization of wireless communication based on frequency ranges. It influences connection statistics, device performance, and network organization, making it a key component in both network setup and data analysis related to wireless communication.\",5\n306,5,\"The entity \"\"5\"\" refers to the 5 GHz wireless frequency band, which is commonly used in wireless communications. This frequency band is one of the primary options available for wireless network connections, alongside other bands such as 2.4 GHz. The 5 GHz band is favored for its higher data transfer rates and reduced interference, making it suitable for high-speed internet activities and modern wireless devices. \n\nIn network settings, \"\"5\"\" often appears as a selectable wireless band option, allowing users to choose the 5 GHz frequency for their connections. Additionally, the term \"\"5\"\" can be used as a numerical value representing the percentage of band usage within a network context, indicating how much of the 5 GHz spectrum is currently being utilized. This helps network administrators monitor and manage bandwidth allocation effectively.\n\nOverall, \"\"5\"\" encapsulates the concept of the 5 GHz wireless band, highlighting its role in providing faster, less congested wireless connectivity, and its representation in network configurations and usage metrics.\",1\n378,MR34,organization,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n63,BAND,CHANNEL UTILIZATION,Band filters data for specific frequency bands,15\n187,5,BAND,The 5 GHz band is enabled in the wireless configuration,6\n189,MR34,BAND,The MR34 model operates on the 5 GHz band,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
