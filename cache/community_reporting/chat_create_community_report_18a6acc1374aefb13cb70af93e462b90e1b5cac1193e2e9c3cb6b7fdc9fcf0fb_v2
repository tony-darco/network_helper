This user is relevant as a person rather than a defined entity type within the system. When connecting to the network, the user may encounter certain access controls such as a splash page, which is a web page displayed upon initial connection, and may be subject to self-registration procedures if enabled. The user's experience and access are influenced by the network's configuration settings, which can include redirecting the user based on specific policies or authentication requirements. Overall, the \"\"USER\"\" is characterized as an individual who accesses the network, potentially encountering various access points and restrictions designed to manage and monitor network usage.\",4\n389,SPLASH PAGE,\"A splash page is a web page that appears before granting access to a Wi-Fi network, serving primarily for authentication or informational purposes. When users connect to a specific SSID (Service Set Identifier), the splash page is displayed to provide necessary information or to facilitate the authentication process required for network access. It functions as an intermediary page that users must interact with—often by entering credentials, accepting terms of service, or viewing important notices—before being granted full access to the internet or network resources. The primary role of a splash page is to ensure secure and controlled access to Wi-Fi networks while also delivering relevant information to users upon connection.\",12\n644,SPLASH URL,\"The \"\"SPLASH URL\"\" is a custom URL designated for the splash page that users encounter when connecting to the network. This URL serves as the initial landing page, providing a branded or informational interface for users upon access. The primary purpose of the SPLASH URL is to redirect users after they log in or connect to the network, guiding them to a specific destination or content. It is often used for login purposes, allowing users to authenticate themselves before gaining full access, or for promotional content, such as advertisements, announcements, or branding messages. By configuring a custom SPLASH URL, network administrators can control the user experience, ensuring that users are directed to relevant or branded content immediately upon connection. Overall, the SPLASH URL plays a crucial role in managing user interactions and delivering targeted content during the initial connection process.\",2\n645,SPLASH THEME,\"The visual theme applied to the splash page, identified by a theme ID\",1\n646,LOGO,\"The entity \"\"LOGO\"\" refers to an image used for branding purposes on the splash page of a website or application. This logo is displayed prominently on the splash page to establish visual identity and brand recognition. The logo is represented as an image file that is associated with the splash page, and it is specified by its MD5 hash and file extension. The MD5 hash serves as a unique identifier for the image file, ensuring integrity and consistency in referencing the correct logo. The image file's extension indicates the format of the logo, such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF, which determines its quality and compatibility. Overall, the \"\"LOGO\"\" is a crucial visual element used to convey branding and identity on the splash page, identified and managed through its MD5 hash and file extension to ensure proper display and integrity.\",1\n651,THEME,\"A visual theme applied to the splash page, identified by 'themeId' to customize appearance\",1\n652,WELCOME MESSAGE,\"A message displayed to users on the splash page, such as \"\"Welcome!\"\"\",1\n653,SPLASH TIMEOUT,\"SPLASH TIMEOUT refers to the duration, measured in minutes, that determines how frequently users are prompted with the splash page. This setting controls the interval at which the splash page appears again for a user, based on the specified timeout period. Common options for the splash timeout include durations such as 30, 60, 120 minutes, among others. Essentially, after a user has viewed the splash page, the timeout period begins, and the splash page will not reappear until this period has elapsed. This configuration helps manage user experience by preventing the splash page from appearing too frequently while ensuring it reappears after the designated timeout period. The term \"\"splash timeout\"\" is used interchangeably with \"\"duration in minutes that determines how often users see the splash page,\"\" emphasizing its role in controlling the frequency of splash page display based on the set timeout duration.\",1\n655,USE SPLASH URL,A boolean setting indicating whether users will be redirected to a custom splash URL,1\n656,USE REDIRECT URL,A boolean setting indicating whether users will be redirected to a custom redirect URL after the splash page,1\n688,MERAKI AUTHENTICATION,EVENT,1\n654,REDIRECT URL,\"The entity \"\"REDIRECT URL\"\" refers to a specific web address designated for redirecting users following their interaction with a splash page. This URL is configured through the parameter 'redirectUrl' and serves as the destination point for users after they have viewed the splash page. When the setting 'useRedirectUrl' is enabled and set to true, users are automatically redirected to this specified URL upon completing their interaction with the splash page. In essence, the \"\"REDIRECT URL\"\" functions as the target location for user redirection post-splash page, ensuring a seamless transition to the intended webpage or resource.\",2\n660,SELF REGISTRATION,\"\"\"SELF REGISTRATION\"\" is a feature that allows users to independently register themselves to access a network. This functionality is designed to facilitate user onboarding by enabling individuals to create their own accounts without requiring direct intervention from administrators. However, the implementation of self-registration is subject to specific controls and settings established by the network administrators. These settings determine whether self-registration is enabled at all, thereby controlling if users can initiate account creation autonomously. Additionally, the authorization process for self-registration can vary, with options including \"\"admin\"\" approval, \"\"auto\"\" registration, or \"\"self_email\"\" verification, ensuring that the registration process aligns with the security and management policies of the network. Overall, self-registration streamlines user access management while maintaining administrative oversight through configurable authorization controls.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n329,USER,NETWORK,Users create accounts to access and use the network,64\n309,SPLASH PAGE,SPLASH URL,The splash page can redirect users to a custom URL,14\n310,SPLASH PAGE,SPLASH THEME,The splash page uses a specific visual theme,13\n311,SPLASH PAGE,LOGO,\"The splash page is designed to include a logo that is identified by its MD5 hash.

Additionally, the splash page displays a logo that is not only identified by its MD5 hash but also includes information about its file extension, indicating the format of the logo image (such as .png, .jpg, etc.). This dual specification ensures that the logo on the splash page is accurately represented and correctly rendered across different platforms and devices.
