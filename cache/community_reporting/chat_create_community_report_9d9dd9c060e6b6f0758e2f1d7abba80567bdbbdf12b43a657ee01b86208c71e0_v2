These clients are identified primarily by their MAC addresses and are considered individual devices or users involved in network activity. They can include various types of devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets, or other endpoints that establish a connection to the wireless network. \n\nClients are characterized by their ability to send and receive data packets, facilitating communication within the network. They are tracked through multiple connection and usage statistics, including association status, authorization, DHCP lease information, and success counts for various network operations. These metrics help monitor the stability, performance, and security of each client connection.\n\nIn addition to technical identifiers, clients are also understood as persons or users operating these devices, whose activity and data usage can be monitored for network management and security purposes. The network's infrastructure maintains records of client connection details, such as latency, connection duration, and overall network engagement, to optimize performance and troubleshoot issues.\n\nOverall, \"\"CLIENT\"\" encompasses all individual devices and users connected to the wireless network, recognized through their MAC addresses and connection statistics, and involved in network data exchange and resource utilization.\",9\n132,LATENCY STATS,\"LATENCY STATS refers to aggregated data that measures the latency performance of network clients over a specified timespan. This data provides a comprehensive overview of network responsiveness by capturing various latency metrics. It includes detailed information grouped by individual clients, allowing for analysis of performance variations across different users or devices. The data encompasses raw latency distributions, which illustrate the spread and frequency of latency values, as well as average latency figures that offer a summarized view of typical network response times. By consolidating these metrics, LATENCY STATS enable network administrators and analysts to assess overall network performance, identify potential bottlenecks or issues affecting specific clients, and make informed decisions to optimize network efficiency and user experience.\",4\n134,MAC ADDRESS,\"Unique identifier for clients in the wireless network, e.g., 00:11:22:33:44:55\",1\n133,AVG,\"Average latency value calculated from latency measurements)<|COMPLETE|>\nAverage latency value calculated from latency measurements\",1\n139,CLIENT ID,\"The \"\"CLIENT ID\"\" serves as a unique identifier assigned to a specific network client device or user within the network system.
