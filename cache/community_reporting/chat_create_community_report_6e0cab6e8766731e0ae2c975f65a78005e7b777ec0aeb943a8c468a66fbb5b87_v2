It uniquely identifies a particular wireless network within a larger infrastructure, enabling administrators and systems to efficiently monitor, analyze, and manage the network's operations. The Network ID is used to distinguish one wireless network from others, facilitating targeted configuration, troubleshooting, and performance analysis.\n\nThis identifier is crucial for managing various aspects of the network, including configuration settings, connection data, and latency measurements. It allows for precise retrieval of connection and latency data associated with the specific network, supporting performance monitoring and optimization efforts. The Network ID also plays a vital role in applying rules and policies tailored to the individual network, ensuring proper management within complex network environments.\n\nIn summary, the Network ID is a fundamental, unique marker that encapsulates the identity of a specific wireless network within a broader system. It is used for management, configuration, monitoring, and analysis purposes, ensuring that each network can be efficiently operated and maintained within the larger network infrastructure.\",18\n90,T0,Start timestamp for querying channel utilization data over a specific timespan.,5\n151,AUTO RESOLUTION,event,1\n123,DEVICE SERIAL,Parameter used to filter results by the serial number of a device in the network,1\n197,WIRELESS MONITORING SYSTEM,\"A system designed to monitor and analyze wireless network latency and performance metrics across various devices, networks, and locations.

In the context of network performance, latency is typically expressed in milliseconds and is a critical metric for assessing the responsiveness and efficiency of a network. The term \"\"latency\"\" encompasses both wired and wireless networks, with particular emphasis on wireless environments where latency can significantly impact user experience. \n\nThe data provided indicates that latency is measured as the average value over a specified timespan, which can be segmented by various parameters such as band, SSID (Service Set Identifier), or VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network). These measurements help in understanding the performance characteristics of different segments of the network, allowing administrators to identify potential bottlenecks or areas requiring optimization. \n\nSpecifically, the average wireless latency is monitored over time to analyze network performance, providing insights into how quickly data packets are transmitted within wireless networks. This information is vital for diagnosing issues related to network responsiveness, especially in environments where real-time data transmission is critical, such as voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing, or online gaming. \n\nOverall, latency serves as a key indicator of network health, with lower latency values generally correlating with better performance and higher user satisfaction. By continuously measuring and analyzing average latency across various network segments and timeframes, network administrators can ensure optimal operation, troubleshoot issues effectively, and enhance the overall quality of service provided by the network infrastructure.\",2\n124,EVENT,\"The entity \"\"EVENT\"\" encompasses a broad range of occurrences within a network environment, serving as a fundamental component in network monitoring, management, and security processes. An event, in this context, is a recorded instance that captures significant activities or issues occurring within the network infrastructure. These events are characterized by various attributes, including timestamp, type, severity, duration, channel, RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), and additional data relevant to the specific incident or activity.\n\nNetwork-related events include detailed records of network activity and issues, such as power mode changes and CPU load history, which reflect device activity and performance over time. These events provide insights into device behavior, operational status, and resource utilization, aiding in performance optimization and troubleshooting.\n\nMonitoring network performance is also represented through events, such as packet loss analysis, which helps identify network degradation or failures. These events are crucial for maintaining network reliability and security, enabling administrators to detect anomalies, diagnose problems, and implement corrective measures promptly.\n\nAdditionally, network management activities generate events related to configuration processes, including API schema interactions and setup activities. These configuration events document changes and updates within the network infrastructure, ensuring proper documentation and facilitating troubleshooting and future modifications.\n\nWhile the provided data does not specify individual discrete events explicitly, it indicates that network monitoring and management are ongoing activities characterized by continuous event recording. These events collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of network health, security, and performance.\n\nIn summary, \"\"EVENT\"\" in this context refers to a wide array of recorded occurrences within a network environment, encompassing device activity logs, performance metrics, security-related incidents, and configuration changes. These events are essential for effective network management, troubleshooting, and security assurance, providing a detailed and structured record of network operations over time.\",5\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n76,NETWORK,AP TAG,Access Points are labeled with specific tags for identification,62\n92,NETWORK ID,T0,\"The entities \"\"NETWORK ID\"\" and \"\"T0\"\" are integral to the data retrieval process within the specified network. \"\"T0\"\" serves as the starting point in time for data collection, marking the initial timestamp from which data is gathered.
