These settings include essential parameters such as UUID, major, and minor numbers, which are used for device identification, communication, and customization of Bluetooth beacons within the network. The configuration also covers aspects related to scanning, advertising, and the ESL (Electronic Shelf Label) status, enabling users to enable, customize, or reset Bluetooth features to facilitate device communication and network integration.\",9\n137,SCANNING ENABLED,\"Boolean setting indicating whether Bluetooth scanning for enabled clients is active on the network, affecting device discovery capabilities\",1\n139,MAJOR MINOR ASSIGNMENT MODE,\"The \"\"MAJOR MINOR ASSIGNMENT MODE\"\" refers to the method used for assigning major and minor numbers in Bluetooth beacons. This method can be either \"\"Unique\"\" or \"\"Non-unique,\"\" which influences how beacon identifiers are managed across devices. When set to \"\"Unique,\"\" each beacon has distinct major and minor numbers, allowing precise identification and grouping of individual beacons. Conversely, the \"\"Non-unique\"\" mode allows multiple beacons to share the same major and minor numbers, which can be useful for grouping or categorizing beacons within a broader context. This assignment mode is crucial for organizing and managing Bluetooth beacon networks effectively, impacting how beacons are identified, grouped, and interacted with within wireless communication environments.\",1\n24,MAJOR,\"The entity \"\"MAJOR\"\" refers to an integer value used in Bluetooth beacon identification, specifically serving as the major number component of the beacon's identifier. It is utilized for grouping or distinguishing beacons, particularly when the beacon operates in \"\"Non-unique\"\" mode. In this mode, the major number helps differentiate groups of beacons, and it can be set or reset as needed for identification purposes. This major number is an essential part of the beacon's overall identification scheme, aiding in the organization and management of beacon groups within wireless communication environments.\",1\n25,MINOR,\"The entity \"\"MINOR\"\" refers to an integer value used in Bluetooth beacon identification, specifically serving as the minor number component of the beacon's identifier. It is utilized for differentiation and grouping purposes within Bluetooth beacon systems. The minor number can be set or reset as needed and is primarily used in \"\"Non-unique\"\" mode, where it allows for finer differentiation within larger major groups. This minor number helps distinguish individual beacons or devices within a broader grouping, facilitating precise identification and management in wireless communication environments.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n94,BLUETOOTH SETTINGS,SCANNING ENABLED,\"Controls whether Bluetooth scanning is active on the network, affecting device discovery\",10\n97,BLUETOOTH SETTINGS,MAJOR MINOR ASSIGNMENT MODE,\"Determines how major and minor numbers are assigned in Bluetooth beacons, affecting beacon identification strategy\",10\n98,BLUETOOTH SETTINGS,MAJOR,\"Major number in Bluetooth beacon, used in 'Non-unique' mode, associated with the network's Bluetooth configuration\",10\n99,BLUETOOTH SETTINGS,MINOR,\"Minor number in Bluetooth beacon, used in 'Non-unique' mode, associated with the network's Bluetooth configuration\",10\n\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}}}, "key": "chat_create_community_report_79939ff4ae689a64ac78eb3f1d863fbdcfc51e8ded0a9a593ea1ee1d6f781a8d_v2"}
