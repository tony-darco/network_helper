It is used by clients to identify, connect to, and distinguish between different Wi-Fi networks within a given environment. The SSID can be represented by names such as \"\"SSID 10,\"\" \"\"SSID 11,\"\" \"\"SSID 12,\"\" or \"\"SSID 13,\"\" indicating different wireless network identifiers. \n\nIn network management and security contexts, the SSID is also associated with allowlist entries, where it is identified by attributes such as ID, name, and number. The SSID plays a crucial role in filtering connection statistics and network data, enabling administrators to monitor and manage wireless network usage effectively. During security scans, such as Air Marshal scans, the SSID is detected as the name of the Wi-Fi network, further emphasizing its role in network identification.\n\nFrom a configuration perspective, the SSID is used in various settings, including API query parameters to filter results by specific SSID numbers. It is also involved in defining minimum bitrate options for wireless networks, where the setting can specify whether the minimum bitrate applies to the 'band' or the 'ssid' itself, with the default being 'band.' Additionally, the selection of band can be set to either 'ssid' or 'ap' (access point), and this parameter is required during network creation.\n\nOverall, the SSID is a critical identifier in wireless networking, serving both as a broadcasted network name and as a key parameter in network configuration, security, and management processes.\",9\n290,BANDSTEERINGENABLED,\"BANDSTEERINGENABLED is a boolean setting that indicates whether the band steering feature is activated for a specific network or SSID. When this setting is enabled (true), it allows the network to automatically direct clients to the most open or optimal wireless band between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. This functionality helps optimize client connections by balancing the load across both frequency bands, thereby improving overall network performance and user experience. The setting can be configured on a per-SSID basis, providing flexibility to enable or disable band steering for different segments of the network. In summary, BANDSTEERINGENABLED is a crucial feature that, when enabled, facilitates intelligent client distribution across the available wireless bands, ensuring efficient utilization of network resources and enhanced connectivity.\",1\n54,WIRELESS PROFILE A,organization,5\n63,IDENTITY,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n25,SSID,ACCESS POINT,Access points broadcast SSIDs to identify wireless networks,13\n166,SSID,BANDSTEERINGENABLED,The band steering feature is enabled or disabled for a specific SSID to optimize client connections,10\n29,WIRELESS PROFILE A,IDENTITY,\"Wireless Profile A is a network configuration profile that includes the necessary identity credentials for authentication purposes.

This setup ensures that only authorized individuals with the correct credentials can access the network, thereby maintaining security and controlled access. The profile's integration of these identity credentials facilitates seamless and secure wireless connectivity for users associated with Wireless Profile A.\",6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
