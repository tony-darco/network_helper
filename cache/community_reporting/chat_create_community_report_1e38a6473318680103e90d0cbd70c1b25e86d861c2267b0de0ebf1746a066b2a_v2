It is an integer parameter used to control the sensitivity of the radio receiver, with a recommended configuration range between -65 dBm and -95 dBm. The RXSOP setting is crucial for optimizing wireless performance, as it determines how sensitive the radio is to incoming signals, thereby affecting the device's ability to detect and process weaker signals.\n\nSpecifically, RXSOP is used to fine-tune the radio sensitivity for the 5GHz band, which is common in modern wireless networks. Adjusting this parameter allows for improved network performance, coverage, and interference management. The setting is intended for advanced users or network administrators with expertise in wireless configurations, as improper adjustments can lead to suboptimal performance or connectivity issues.\n\nThe RXSOP level is configurable within the specified range, and it is recommended to seek expert advice when making changes to ensure optimal network operation. The setting essentially acts as a receive sensitivity threshold, with a typical value around -95 dBm representing high sensitivity, capable of detecting weaker signals, while a value closer to -65 dBm indicates lower sensitivity, which might be used to reduce interference or improve signal quality in certain environments.\n\nIn summary, RXSOP is a critical parameter for advanced wireless tuning, allowing precise control over radio sensitivity for the 5GHz band, with recommended configuration guidance provided by experts to achieve the best balance between coverage, performance, and interference mitigation.\",3\n228,FIVEGHZSETTINGS,\"A collection of settings related to the 5GHz Wi-Fi band, including maxPower, minPower, minBitrate, validAutoChannels, channelWidth, and rxsop\",7\n229,MAXPOWER,\"MAXPOWER refers to the maximum transmission power settings for wireless devices, specifically for the 5GHz and 6GHz frequency bands. The entity's configuration allows for adjustable power levels within a range of 2 to 30 dBm for both bands, with the default setting established at 30 dBm. This means that, by default, MAXPOWER is set to the highest permissible power level, but it can be customized based on specific requirements or regulatory constraints. The maximum power setting for each band is typically configured within the wireless profile, ensuring that the device operates at the desired transmission strength. Overall, MAXPOWER provides a flexible and standardized way to control the maximum transmission power for wireless communications on the 5GHz and 6GHz bands, optimizing performance and compliance with regional regulations.\",3\n234,SIXGHZSETTINGS,\"Settings related to the 6GHz Wi-Fi band, including maxPower, minPower, minBitrate, validAutoChannels, channelWidth, and rxsop\",6\n230,MINPOWER,\"MINPOWER is an entity responsible for managing the minimum transmission power settings across multiple wireless frequency bands. Specifically, MINPOWER sets the minimum power levels in decibels-milliwatts (dBm) for the 5GHz and 6GHz bands, with adjustable ranges from 2 dBm to 30 dBm. The default setting for both the 5GHz and 6GHz bands is 8 dBm, ensuring a baseline transmission power that balances coverage and interference considerations. Additionally, MINPOWER encompasses the configuration of minimum transmission power for other bands, such as the 2.4 GHz band, where the minimum power can be set individually (e.g., 5 dBm for 2.4 GHz) within the wireless profile. This allows for precise control over the minimum signal strength emitted by wireless devices, optimizing network performance, coverage, and compliance with regulatory standards. Overall, MINPOWER provides a flexible and configurable framework for setting the lower bounds of wireless transmission power across multiple frequency bands, ensuring consistent and reliable wireless communication tailored to specific deployment needs.\",3\n231,MINBITRATE,\"MINBITRATE refers to the minimum data transfer rate, measured in Mbps, that an SSID or wireless profile supports to ensure baseline performance and connection quality. It is a critical parameter used to define the lowest acceptable data transfer rate for wireless connections across various frequency bands and SSIDs.\n\nSpecifically, MINBITRATE is used to set the minimum Mbps bitrate for SSIDs within indoor RF profiles, ensuring that the wireless network maintains a certain level of performance. This setting influences the connection quality and speed by preventing devices from connecting at data rates below the specified minimum.\n\nFor the 5GHz band, MINBITRATE can be configured with selectable options including 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps, with a default value of 12 Mbps. Similarly, for the 6GHz band, the available options are 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps, also defaulting to 12 Mbps. These settings allow network administrators to tailor the minimum data rate to meet specific performance and coverage requirements.\n\nAdditionally, MINBITRATE can be set individually for each SSID within a profile, with the setting indicating the lowest data transfer rate permitted for that particular SSID. This ensures that each wireless network maintains a baseline performance level, which can be crucial for managing network quality, especially in environments with diverse device capabilities or performance needs.\n\nOverall, MINBITRATE is a configurable parameter that plays a vital role in optimizing wireless network performance by establishing the minimum data rate threshold, thereby balancing connection stability, speed, and coverage across different frequency bands and SSIDs.\",3\n232,VALIDAUTOCHANNELS,\"VALIDAUTOCHANNELS is an entity that encompasses the comprehensive list of valid automatic channels across multiple Wi-Fi frequency bands, specifically the 5GHz and 6GHz bands. For the 5GHz band, VALIDAUTOCHANNELS includes a range of channels such as 36, 40, 44, 48, and other channels within the band’s spectrum, along with a default list of channels that are typically used or recommended for automatic selection. Similarly, for the 6GHz band, the entity includes channels like 1, 5, 9, 13, and additional channels within the 6GHz spectrum, accompanied by a default list of valid channels suitable for automatic configuration.\n\nIn addition to these, VALIDAUTOCHANNELS also maintains a list of auto-selected channels that are considered valid for each band. For example, in the 2.4 GHz band, common auto-selected channels include 1, 6, and 11, which are widely recognized as optimal to minimize interference. These auto-selected channels are chosen based on their validity and suitability for automatic deployment, ensuring optimal performance and minimal interference in wireless networks.\n\nOverall, VALIDAUTOCHANNELS serves as a centralized reference for the valid, default, and auto-selected channels across the 2.4 GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz Wi-Fi bands. It provides essential information for configuring wireless networks, ensuring that devices operate on channels that are permissible, optimized, and less prone to interference, thereby enhancing network stability and performance.\",3\n233,CHANNELWIDTH,\"CHANNELWIDTH refers to the configuration setting for the channel width in wireless networks, specifically for the 5GHz and 6GHz frequency bands. For the 5GHz band, the available options include 'auto', '20 MHz', '40 MHz', and '80 MHz', with the default setting being 'auto'. This allows the device or network administrator to select an appropriate channel width based on network requirements, interference levels, and performance considerations. The 'auto' setting enables the system to automatically select the optimal channel width for the 5GHz band.\n\nFor the 6GHz band, the options include '0', '20 MHz', '40 MHz', '80 MHz', and '160 MHz', with the default also being 'auto'. The inclusion of '0' likely indicates an automatic or default setting similar to 'auto'. The wider channel widths, such as 160 MHz, are designed to support higher data throughput, which is particularly beneficial for high-bandwidth applications. The configuration of channel width can be set individually for each band within a network profile, allowing for tailored optimization based on specific deployment scenarios.\n\nOverall, the channel width setting is a critical parameter in wireless network configuration, influencing both the speed and stability of the connection. Proper selection of channel width can enhance network performance, reduce interference, and improve user experience across both the 5GHz and 6GHz bands.\",3\n226,AXENABLED,\"AXENABLED is a configuration setting that indicates whether Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) technology is enabled within a network profile. When AXENABLED is set to true, it signifies that the device or network profile supports and utilizes the 802.11ax standard, which offers improved speed, efficiency, and capacity compared to previous Wi-Fi standards. Conversely, if AXENABLED is set to false, the device does not support Wi-Fi 6, and the network operates without the benefits of this standard.\n\nIn addition to indicating the activation of Wi-Fi 6, AXENABLED is associated with a related setting that controls the 2.4GHz band radio. This setting determines whether the 2.4GHz frequency band is turned on or off. The default value for this radio is true, meaning the 2.4GHz band is enabled by default, allowing devices to connect over this frequency. When the 2.4GHz band is enabled, it can support legacy devices and provide better range, but it may be more susceptible to interference and congestion.\n\nFurthermore, it is recommended to disable band steering if the 2.4GHz band radio is turned off. Band steering is a feature that encourages dual-band capable devices to connect to the 5GHz band for faster performance and less interference. If the 2.4GHz band is disabled, disabling band steering prevents the network from attempting to steer devices to the 5GHz band, which may not be suitable for all devices or use cases.\n\nIn summary, AXENABLED is a key setting that indicates whether Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is enabled in a network profile. It is closely related to the status of the 2.4GHz band radio, which is enabled by default and can be turned off if desired. When the 2.4GHz band is disabled, it is advisable to disable band steering to ensure proper device connectivity and network performance. This comprehensive configuration allows network administrators to optimize wireless performance, compatibility, and coverage based on their specific requirements.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n145,RXSOP,FIVEGHZSETTINGS,\"The RXSOP setting controls radio sensitivity for the 5GHz band\nRX-SOP level is a setting within the 5GHz band configuration\",10\n147,FIVEGHZSETTINGS,MAXPOWER,Max power setting is part of the 5GHz band configuration,10\n146,RXSOP,SIXGHZSETTINGS,RX-SOP level is a setting within the 6GHz band configuration,9\n152,MAXPOWER,SIXGHZSETTINGS,Max power setting is part of the 6GHz band configuration,9\n153,MINPOWER,SIXGHZSETTINGS,Min power setting is part of the 6GHz band configuration,9\n154,MINBITRATE,SIXGHZSETTINGS,Min bitrate is a parameter within the 6GHz settings,9\n155,VALIDAUTOCHANNELS,SIXGHZSETTINGS,Valid auto channels are specified for the 6GHz band,9\n156,CHANNELWIDTH,SIXGHZSETTINGS,Channel width setting is part of the 6GHz band configuration,9\n144,AXENABLED,FIVEGHZSETTINGS,\"The AX radio band setting is part of the 2.4GHz band configuration, influencing wireless operation\",8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
