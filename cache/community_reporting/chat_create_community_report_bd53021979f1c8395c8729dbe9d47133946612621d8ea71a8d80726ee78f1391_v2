The \"\"NETWORK ID\"\" is essential for configuring, managing, and querying network settings, ensuring precise identification and control over each network. In the context of wireless networks, the \"\"NETWORK ID\"\" specifically refers to the identifier assigned to a particular wireless network, facilitating targeted management and monitoring.

It functions by creating separate logical networks within a physical network, allowing for the segmentation of traffic for different clients or departments. This method enhances network security, improves performance, and simplifies network management by filtering connection data and isolating traffic streams. The VLAN is identified by a unique virtual LAN identifier (VLAN ID), which facilitates the configuration and management of these segmented networks. It is a technical term related to network segmentation and does not refer to any specific organization, person, geographic location, or event. Overall, VLANs are essential tools in modern network design, enabling efficient and secure traffic management within complex network environments.\",3\n23,TIMESPAN,\"TIMESPAN refers to the duration over which network latency data is collected and analyzed. It specifies the period, measured in seconds, during which connection data is fetched and monitored. The timespan is an important parameter for understanding network performance and is used to evaluate latency trends over a defined interval. The maximum allowable duration for this data collection is seven days, ensuring that the analysis remains manageable and relevant for performance assessments. By defining the timespan, TIMESPAN helps in accurately capturing network behavior over a specified period, facilitating effective troubleshooting, capacity planning, and performance optimization.\",4\n153,LATENCY,event,2\n142,EVENT,\"A record of a specific network activity such as assoc, auth, DHCP, etc.\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n76,NETWORK,AP TAG,Access Points are labeled with specific tags for identification,37\n92,NETWORK ID,T0,\"The entities \"\"NETWORK ID\"\" and \"\"T0\"\" are integral to the data retrieval process within the specified network. \"\"T0\"\" serves as the starting point in time for data collection, marking the initial timestamp from which data is gathered.
