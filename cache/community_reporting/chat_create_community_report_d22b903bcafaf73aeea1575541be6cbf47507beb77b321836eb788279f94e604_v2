Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n13,UUID,\"A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a string used in Bluetooth beacon technology to uniquely identify beacons, networks, or services. It ensures proper device recognition and distinguishes individual beacons within a network. Specifically, in Bluetooth configurations, UUIDs are employed to identify and differentiate beacons or devices, facilitating accurate communication and management. In Meraki's BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) configuration, UUIDs serve to uniquely identify networks or services, enabling precise targeting and interaction within Bluetooth-enabled environments. Overall, the UUID plays a crucial role in beacon identification by providing a unique identifier that helps distinguish different beacons, networks, or services, ensuring reliable and organized Bluetooth device management.\",2\n113,BEACON,,5\n105,MAJORMINORASSIGNMENTMODE,\"Mode determining how major and minor numbers are assigned to beacons, either 'Unique' or 'Non-unique'.\",1\n14,MAJOR,\"The entity \"\"MAJOR\"\" refers to a specific numerical identifier used within Bluetooth beacon configurations. It is primarily employed in the \"\"Non-unique\"\" mode of beacon operation, where it serves to differentiate groups of beacons within a larger network or deployment. The major number is typically an integer value that helps categorize and organize beacons by grouping them into distinct sets, facilitating easier management and identification. In practical terms, the major value is used in beacon identifiers to distinguish one group of beacons from another, enabling precise targeting and monitoring within complex deployments. This identifier is integral to the configuration process, allowing administrators to assign and recognize specific beacon groups based on their major number. Overall, the major number is a crucial component in Bluetooth beacon settings, providing a straightforward means to categorize beacons and streamline network management in environments where multiple beacons are deployed.\",1\n15,MINOR,\"The entity \"\"MINOR\"\" refers to a specific numerical identifier used within Bluetooth beacon configurations. It is primarily employed in the context of beacon identification and management, particularly when operating in \"\"Non-unique\"\" mode. In this mode, the minor number functions as an integer value that differentiates individual beacons within a group, allowing for more precise identification of each device. The minor number is an essential component of beacon identifiers, providing finer granularity beyond the primary identifier (such as the UUID). It is used to distinguish between multiple beacons that share the same major number or group identifier, enabling applications and systems to recognize and interact with specific beacons within a network. Overall, the minor number is a crucial element in Bluetooth beacon configuration, facilitating detailed device management and targeted interactions within beacon groups.\",1\n100,MERAKI NETWORK,\"A specific network managed by Meraki, configured with Bluetooth settings such as scanning, advertising, UUID, major, and minor numbers\nA specific network managed by Meraki, configured with Bluetooth settings such as scanning and advertising options, UUID, and major/minor numbers\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n48,UUID,BEACON,UUID uniquely identifies each beacon within the network,7\n49,MAJORMINORASSIGNMENTMODE,BEACON,Mode determines how major and minor numbers are assigned to beacons,6\n50,MAJOR,BEACON,\"Major number is part of beacon identification, used in 'Non-unique' mode\",6\n51,MINOR,BEACON,\"Minor number is part of beacon identification, used in 'Non-unique' mode\",6\n47,UUID,MERAKI NETWORK,The UUID is used within the Meraki network for Bluetooth beacon identification,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
