It is used to distinctly recognize individual network instances, whether they are wired or wireless. The \"\"NETWORK ID\"\" is essential for configuring, managing, and querying network settings, ensuring precise identification and control over each network. In the context of wireless networks, the \"\"NETWORK ID\"\" specifically refers to the identifier assigned to a particular wireless network, facilitating targeted management and monitoring. Overall, the \"\"NETWORK ID\"\" functions as a critical parameter that uniquely distinguishes each network within the Cisco Meraki environment, enabling efficient network administration and accurate data retrieval for network instances.\",17\n23,TIMESPAN,\"TIMESPAN refers to the duration over which network latency data is collected and analyzed. It specifies the period, measured in seconds, during which connection data is fetched and monitored. The timespan is an important parameter for understanding network performance and is used to evaluate latency trends over a defined interval. The maximum allowable duration for this data collection is seven days, ensuring that the analysis remains manageable and relevant for performance assessments. By defining the timespan, TIMESPAN helps in accurately capturing network behavior over a specified period, facilitating effective troubleshooting, capacity planning, and performance optimization.\",4\n19,VLAN,\"A VLAN, or Virtual Local Area Network, is a network segmentation technology used within network infrastructure to isolate and manage traffic effectively. It functions by creating separate logical networks within a physical network, allowing for the segmentation of traffic for different clients or departments. This method enhances network security, improves performance, and simplifies network management by filtering connection data and isolating traffic streams. The VLAN is identified by a unique virtual LAN identifier (VLAN ID), which facilitates the configuration and management of these segmented networks. It is a technical term related to network segmentation and does not refer to any specific organization, person, geographic location, or event. Overall, VLANs are essential tools in modern network design, enabling efficient and secure traffic management within complex network environments.\",3\n125,AP TAG,Identifier for a specific access point in the network,2\n175,AUTO RESOLUTION,event,1\n124,DEVICE SERIAL,Unique serial number or identifier for a network device,1\n229,WIRELESS MONITORING SYSTEM,\"A system designed to monitor and analyze wireless network latency and performance metrics across various devices, networks, and locations.

Both \"\"T0\"\" and \"\"T1\"\" are used to define a specific time window for data retrieval, with \"\"T0\"\" representing the beginning of this period. The data collection process begins precisely at timestamp \"\"T0,\"\" ensuring that all relevant data within the designated time frame is captured. This setup allows for a structured and time-bound approach to data analysis, enabling users to specify the exact interval for which they wish to retrieve information from the network identified by \"\"NETWORK ID.\"\" In summary, \"\"T0\"\" is the initial timestamp that, together with \"\"T1,\"\" delineates the period during which data is collected from the network, starting at \"\"T0\"\" and ending at \"\"T1.\"\"\",21\n94,NETWORK ID,TIMESPAN,\"The \"\"TIMESPAN\"\" entity specifies the duration for data retrieval or collection. It serves as a parameter that defines the length of time over which data is gathered. When the \"\"TIMESPAN\"\" is provided, it can replace the parameters T0 and T1, which typically denote specific start and end times for data collection. The \"\"TIMESPAN\"\" is measured in seconds, indicating the total duration of data collection in seconds. This parameter ensures that data is retrieved or collected over a precise, predefined period, streamlining the process by eliminating the need for explicit start and end timestamps when \"\"TIMESPAN\"\" is used. Overall, \"\"TIMESPAN\"\" is a crucial parameter for controlling the temporal scope of data retrieval, providing a flexible and efficient way to specify the duration of data collection in seconds.\",21\n141,NETWORK ID,VLAN,Filtering results by VLAN identifiers,20\n99,NETWORK ID,AP TAG,\"The \"\"AP TAG\"\" entity is used to filter data related to specific access points within a network. By applying AP TAG filters, users can narrow down the results to include only information associated with particular access points identified by their tags. This functionality allows for targeted analysis and management of network data, enabling administrators to focus on specific access points for troubleshooting, performance monitoring, or security purposes. The use of AP TAGs enhances the ability to organize and interpret network data efficiently by associating data filtering directly with designated access point identifiers.
