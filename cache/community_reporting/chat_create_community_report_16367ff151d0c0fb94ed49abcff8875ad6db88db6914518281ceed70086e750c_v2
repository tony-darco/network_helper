This user is relevant as a person rather than a defined entity type within the system. When connecting to the network, the user may encounter certain access controls such as a splash page, which is a web page displayed upon initial connection, and may be subject to self-registration procedures if enabled. The user's experience and access are influenced by the network's configuration settings, which can include redirecting the user based on specific policies or authentication requirements. Overall, the \"\"USER\"\" is characterized as an individual who accesses the network, potentially encountering various access points and restrictions designed to manage and monitor network usage.\",4\n644,SPLASH URL,\"The \"\"SPLASH URL\"\" is a custom URL designated for the splash page that users encounter when connecting to the network. This URL serves as the initial landing page, providing a branded or informational interface for users upon access. The primary purpose of the SPLASH URL is to redirect users after they log in or connect to the network, guiding them to a specific destination or content. It is often used for login purposes, allowing users to authenticate themselves before gaining full access, or for promotional content, such as advertisements, announcements, or branding messages. By configuring a custom SPLASH URL, network administrators can control the user experience, ensuring that users are directed to relevant or branded content immediately upon connection. Overall, the SPLASH URL plays a crucial role in managing user interactions and delivering targeted content during the initial connection process.\",2\n660,SELF REGISTRATION,\"\"\"SELF REGISTRATION\"\" is a feature that allows users to independently register themselves to access a network. This functionality is designed to facilitate user onboarding by enabling individuals to create their own accounts without requiring direct intervention from administrators. However, the implementation of self-registration is subject to specific controls and settings established by the network administrators. These settings determine whether self-registration is enabled at all, thereby controlling if users can initiate account creation autonomously. Additionally, the authorization process for self-registration can vary, with options including \"\"admin\"\" approval, \"\"auto\"\" registration, or \"\"self_email\"\" verification, ensuring that the registration process aligns with the security and management policies of the network. Overall, self-registration streamlines user access management while maintaining administrative oversight through configurable authorization controls.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n329,USER,NETWORK,Users create accounts to access and use the network,64\n323,SPLASH URL,USER,Users are redirected to the custom splash URL after connecting,6\n322,SELF REGISTRATION,USER,Users can create accounts if self-registration is enabled,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
