It is characterized by a network profile that encompasses various wireless settings and SSID configurations, which are tailored to support the office’s communication and connectivity needs. The main office functions as a specific site where network equipment, such as access points (APs), are deployed to facilitate wireless connectivity for employees and devices within the premises. This location is integral to the organization’s overall network architecture, providing essential connectivity services and serving as the core point for network management and configuration. The network profile associated with the MAIN OFFICE ensures that wireless settings are optimized for performance, security, and reliability, supporting the operational requirements of the organization at this central site.\",19\n265,SIXGHZ,The 6 GHz band used for wireless communication in the network profile,1\n263,2.4,\"The entity \"\"2.4\"\" refers to the 2.4 GHz wireless band, which is a commonly used frequency range in wireless network configurations. This band is part of the standard set of wireless frequency bands used to facilitate wireless communication. Specifically, the 2.4 GHz band is enabled within the network profile associated with SSID 14, indicating that this frequency is active and available for wireless communication in that particular network setup. The 2.4 GHz band is widely utilized due to its ability to provide reliable coverage over longer distances and through obstacles, making it a popular choice for various wireless devices and applications. In this context, the 2.4 GHz band is an integral component of the network's wireless configuration, ensuring connectivity and communication for devices operating within the network profile.\",1\n266,SSID 3,\"SSID 3 is a designated wireless network segment within the main office network profile, distinguished by its unique name and specific configuration settings. It functions as a separate SSID (Service Set Identifier) that allows devices to connect to a dedicated wireless network within the organization's infrastructure. The configuration of SSID 3 includes several key parameters designed to optimize network performance and security.\n\nNotably, SSID 3 has defined settings related to its network operation, such as a minimum bitrate requirement, which ensures that connected devices maintain a certain level of data transfer speed for reliable communication. Additionally, the SSID operates on specific frequency bands, with configurable band settings that determine whether it functions on 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, or both, depending on the network's needs and device compatibility.\n\nThe network configuration for SSID 3 also includes steering options, which are mechanisms to guide client devices to connect to the most appropriate band or access point, thereby enhancing overall network efficiency and user experience. These steering features help balance the load across different bands and access points, reducing congestion and improving connection stability.\n\nOverall, SSID 3 is a carefully configured wireless network segment tailored to meet the organization's performance and security requirements.
