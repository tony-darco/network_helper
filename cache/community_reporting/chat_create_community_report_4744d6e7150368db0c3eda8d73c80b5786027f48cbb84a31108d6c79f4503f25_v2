Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n351,RADIUS ATTRIBUTE FOR GROUP POLICIES,\"The \"\"RADIUS ATTRIBUTE FOR GROUP POLICIES\"\" refers to the specific RADIUS attribute used to identify and associate group policies within a wireless network environment. These attributes include options such as \"\"Airespace-ACL-Name,\"\" \"\"Aruba-User-Role,\"\" \"\"Filter-Id,\"\" and \"\"Reply-Message.\"\" They serve to link user sessions to particular group policies, enabling network administrators to enforce role-based access control and policy management effectively. The attributes \"\"Aruba-User-Role\"\" and \"\"Filter-Id\"\" are commonly used for this purpose, facilitating the assignment of user roles and filtering policies within the network infrastructure managed by Aruba or Airespace systems.\",2\n348,RADIUS FAILOVER POLICY,\"The \"\"RADIUS FAILOVER POLICY\"\" is a network management configuration that determines how authentication requests are handled in scenarios where all RADIUS servers become unreachable. This policy specifies the behavior during such outages, with options including allowing access or denying access to users attempting to authenticate. It is a critical component in ensuring network security and availability, especially in environments relying on RADIUS for centralized authentication. The policy helps maintain operational continuity by defining clear procedures for authentication request handling when the primary authentication infrastructure is unavailable.\",2\n349,RADIUS LOAD BALANCING POLICY,\"The \"\"RADIUS LOAD BALANCING POLICY\"\" is a policy that defines the order in which RADIUS servers are contacted during the authentication process. It determines the sequence of server contact, with options including \"\"Round robin,\"\" which distributes authentication requests evenly across multiple servers, and \"\"Strict priority order,\"\" which contacts servers based on a predefined priority sequence. This policy is essential for managing load distribution and ensuring reliable authentication in wireless networks and network management environments that utilize RADIUS for authentication services.\",2\n352,IP ASSIGNMENT MODE,\"The \"\"IP ASSIGNMENT MODE\"\" refers to the method used to assign IP addresses to clients within a network. It encompasses various modes such as \"\"Bridge mode,\"\" which allows clients to operate on the same subnet as the network; \"\"Ethernet over GRE,\"\" which encapsulates Ethernet frames over GRE tunnels for remote connectivity; \"\"Layer 3 roaming,\"\" enabling seamless IP address management as clients move across different network segments; \"\"NAT mode,\"\" where Network Address Translation is used to assign private IP addresses and manage traffic routing; \"\"Layer 3 roaming with a concentrator,\"\" which involves centralized management of IP addresses during client mobility; and \"\"VPN,\"\" which assigns IP addresses through virtual private network tunnels, ensuring secure remote access. These modes determine how network traffic is managed and routed, facilitating flexible and efficient client connectivity in various wireless and wired network environments.\",2\n337,RADIUS SERVER,\"The RADIUS server is a critical component in enterprise wireless networks, serving primarily for authentication, authorization, and accounting purposes. It is identified by its host IP address or Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), specific port, and associated security certificates, which facilitate secure communication with wireless clients and network devices. The server supports secure user verification, enabling it to authenticate users and devices attempting to access the network. Additionally, it can assign VLANs and enforce network policies based on user credentials and roles, ensuring proper segmentation and security within the wireless environment.
