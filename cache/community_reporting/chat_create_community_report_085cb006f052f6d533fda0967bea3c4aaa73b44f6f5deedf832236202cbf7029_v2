For the 5GHz band, the available options include 'auto', '20 MHz', '40 MHz', and '80 MHz', with the default setting being 'auto'. This allows the device or network administrator to select an appropriate channel width based on network requirements, interference levels, and performance considerations. The 'auto' setting enables the system to automatically select the optimal channel width for the 5GHz band.\n\nFor the 6GHz band, the options include '0', '20 MHz', '40 MHz', '80 MHz', and '160 MHz', with the default also being 'auto'. The inclusion of '0' likely indicates an automatic or default setting similar to 'auto'. The wider channel widths, such as 160 MHz, are designed to support higher data throughput, which is particularly beneficial for high-bandwidth applications. The configuration of channel width can be set individually for each band within a network profile, allowing for tailored optimization based on specific deployment scenarios.\n\nOverall, the channel width setting is a critical parameter in wireless network configuration, influencing both the speed and stability of the connection. Proper selection of channel width can enhance network performance, reduce interference, and improve user experience across both the 5GHz and 6GHz bands.\",3\n226,AXENABLED,\"AXENABLED is a configuration setting that indicates whether Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) technology is enabled within a network profile. When AXENABLED is set to true, it signifies that the device or network profile supports and utilizes the 802.11ax standard, which offers improved speed, efficiency, and capacity compared to previous Wi-Fi standards. Conversely, if AXENABLED is set to false, the device does not support Wi-Fi 6, and the network operates without the benefits of this standard.\n\nIn addition to indicating the activation of Wi-Fi 6, AXENABLED is associated with a related setting that controls the 2.4GHz band radio. This setting determines whether the 2.4GHz frequency band is turned on or off. The default value for this radio is true, meaning the 2.4GHz band is enabled by default, allowing devices to connect over this frequency. When the 2.4GHz band is enabled, it can support legacy devices and provide better range, but it may be more susceptible to interference and congestion.\n\nFurthermore, it is recommended to disable band steering if the 2.4GHz band radio is turned off. Band steering is a feature that encourages dual-band capable devices to connect to the 5GHz band for faster performance and less interference. If the 2.4GHz band is disabled, disabling band steering prevents the network from attempting to steer devices to the 5GHz band, which may not be suitable for all devices or use cases.\n\nIn summary, AXENABLED is a key setting that indicates whether Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is enabled in a network profile. It is closely related to the status of the 2.4GHz band radio, which is enabled by default and can be turned off if desired.
