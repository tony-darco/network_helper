Specifically, it encompasses instances where a client successfully associates with the network, which involves establishing a connection and includes the collection of connection details such as device information, signal strength, and authentication parameters. Additionally, \"\"ASSOC\"\" also covers scenarios where the association process fails, such as during the client onboarding process, indicating an unsuccessful attempt to connect to the wireless network. These association events are critical for monitoring network connectivity, diagnosing connection issues, and ensuring proper client onboarding procedures. Overall, \"\"ASSOC\"\" serves as a key indicator of client-network interactions, capturing both successful connections and failures during the association phase.\",2\n114,AUTH,\"The entity \"\"AUTH\"\" pertains to the authentication process within a network. It encompasses events related to a client's attempt to verify their identity and gain access to the network resources. Specifically, \"\"AUTH\"\" includes instances where a client has successfully authenticated, indicating that the client has successfully provided valid credentials and has been granted access to the network. Conversely, \"\"AUTH\"\" also covers authentication failures that occur during the client onboarding process, which indicate unsuccessful attempts to verify the client's identity, potentially due to incorrect credentials or other issues preventing access. Overall, \"\"AUTH\"\" reflects both successful and unsuccessful authentication events, serving as a key indicator of client access attempts and security validation within the network infrastructure.\",2\n115,DHCP,\"DHCP, or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks. It facilitates the assignment of IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to client devices, enabling them to communicate effectively within the network. A DHCP event typically indicates a process such as IP address assignment for a client device, which is essential for establishing network connectivity. \n\nIn the context of network onboarding, a DHCP failure step refers to an issue encountered during the initial setup or onboarding process of a device, where the DHCP process fails to successfully assign an IP address or complete the necessary configuration. Such failures can hinder the device's ability to connect to the network, potentially requiring troubleshooting or alternative configuration methods to resolve the issue.\n\nOverall, DHCP plays a critical role in network management by simplifying device configuration and ensuring seamless connectivity. When DHCP processes succeed, devices are efficiently assigned network parameters; when they fail, it can lead to connectivity problems, especially during onboarding or initial device setup.\",2\n116,SUCCESS,An event indicating successful connection or operation within the network,1\n192,FAILED CONNECTION EVENTS,\"Instances where client devices failed to connect to the network, recorded with details such as timestamp and failure step\",6\n193,CLIENT MAC,Unique identifier (MAC address) of a client device attempting to connect to the network,1\n195,DNS,Domain Name System failure step during client onboarding process,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n85,CONNECTION STATS,ASSOC,Assoc events are part of connection stats indicating client association,8\n86,CONNECTION STATS,AUTH,Auth events are part of connection stats indicating successful authentication,8\n87,CONNECTION STATS,DHCP,DHCP events are part of connection stats indicating IP address assignment,8\n88,CONNECTION STATS,SUCCESS,Success events indicate successful network operations,7\n120,FAILED CONNECTION EVENTS,CLIENT MAC,Client MAC addresses are involved in the failed connection events,7\n121,FAILED CONNECTION EVENTS,DNS,DNS failure is one of the failure steps recorded during client onboarding,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
