It serves as a content type indicator in API responses, signaling that the data returned from a server or API is structured in JSON format. This media type is widely adopted in web development and API communications due to JSON's lightweight, easy-to-parse, and human-readable structure. When a server responds with the \"application/json\" content type, it ensures that the client understands the data is in JSON format, facilitating seamless data exchange and integration between systems. Overall, \"application/json\" plays a crucial role in modern web services by standardizing the format of data transmitted over HTTP, enabling efficient and consistent communication in web applications and APIs.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218494, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
