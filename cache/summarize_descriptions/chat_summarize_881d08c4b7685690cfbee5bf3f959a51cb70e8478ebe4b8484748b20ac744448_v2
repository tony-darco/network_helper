This frequency range is widely employed in various wireless networking standards, including Wi-Fi, to facilitate high-speed data transmission and reduce interference compared to lower frequency bands such as 2.4 GHz. In addition to its role as a frequency band, the number \"5\" also represents a numerical value indicating the percentage of band usage within a network context. This usage percentage reflects how much of the 5 GHz bandâ€™s capacity is currently being utilized in a given network environment, providing insight into network load and performance. Together, these descriptions highlight that \"5\" pertains both to a specific wireless frequency band and to a measurement of its utilization, emphasizing its importance in wireless communication infrastructure and network management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218491, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 161, "total_tokens": 323, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
