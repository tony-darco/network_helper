It is used by clients to identify, connect to, and distinguish between different Wi-Fi networks within a given environment. The SSID can be represented by names such as \"SSID 10,\" \"SSID 11,\" \"SSID 12,\" or \"SSID 13,\" indicating different wireless network identifiers. \n\nIn network management and security contexts, the SSID is also associated with allowlist entries, where it is identified by attributes such as ID, name, and number. The SSID plays a crucial role in filtering connection statistics and network data, enabling administrators to monitor and manage wireless network usage effectively. During security scans, such as Air Marshal scans, the SSID is detected as the name of the Wi-Fi network, further emphasizing its role in network identification.\n\nFrom a configuration perspective, the SSID is used in various settings, including API query parameters to filter results by specific SSID numbers. It is also involved in defining minimum bitrate options for wireless networks, where the setting can specify whether the minimum bitrate applies to the 'band' or the 'ssid' itself, with the default being 'band.' Additionally, the selection of band can be set to either 'ssid' or 'ap' (access point), and this parameter is required during network creation.\n\nOverall, the SSID is a critical identifier in wireless networking, serving both as a broadcasted network name and as a key parameter in network configuration, security, and management processes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215435, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 321, "prompt_tokens": 495, "total_tokens": 816, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
