It serves as a key component in managing network security and user permissions by enabling group policy lookups. Specifically, Aruba-User-Role allows network administrators to define and enforce role-based access controls, ensuring that users are granted appropriate levels of access based on their assigned roles. This attribute streamlines the process of managing user privileges across Aruba's wireless and wired network infrastructure, contributing to a more secure and organized network environment. By leveraging Aruba-User-Role, organizations can efficiently implement policy-based access management, improve network security posture, and simplify user role administration within Aruba's network ecosystem.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218491, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 330, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
