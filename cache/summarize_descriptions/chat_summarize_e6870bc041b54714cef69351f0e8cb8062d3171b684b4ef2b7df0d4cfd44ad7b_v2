These statistics encompass various metrics that collectively provide insights into the quality and stability of network connections. Specifically, connection statistics include information about signal strength, which indicates the quality of the wireless link between the device and the access point, as well as connection duration, reflecting how long a device remains connected to the network. Band usage metrics are also included, showing which frequency bands (such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) are utilized during the connection, thereby offering insights into network load and performance.\n\nFurthermore, connection statistics cover key connection attributes such as association and authentication processes, which are essential steps in establishing a secure and functional connection between a client device and the network. The data also includes details about DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) processes, which are responsible for assigning IP addresses to devices upon connection, ensuring proper network communication. Success rates for these various processes—association, authentication, DHCP—are also recorded, providing an overall measure of connection reliability and stability.\n\nIn summary, \"CONNECTION STATS\" serve as a vital tool for analyzing the performance and reliability of wireless network connections. They aggregate data on signal quality, connection duration, band usage, and the success rates of critical connection procedures such as association, authentication, and DHCP. This comprehensive data helps network administrators monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize wireless network performance, ensuring efficient and stable connectivity for all clients on the network.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215435, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 521, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
