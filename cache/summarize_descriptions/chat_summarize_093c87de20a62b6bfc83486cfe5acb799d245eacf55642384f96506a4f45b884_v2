They serve as identifiers that enable devices to recognize and connect to specific Wi-Fi networks. Each SSID can be configured with various settings to enhance security, usability, and management. These configurations often include specific splash pages, which are web-based login or informational pages presented to users upon connection, and scheduled operational times, known as outage schedules, during which the SSID may be active or inactive. Multiple SSIDs can be associated with a single network, each tailored with distinct configurations to serve different user groups, access levels, or purposes. For example, an organization might deploy separate SSIDs for employees, guests, and IoT devices, each with customized security protocols, access restrictions, and user experience settings. The configurations may also include identity pre-shared keys (PSKs) to secure access and ensure that only authorized users can connect to each network segment. Overall, SSIDs are fundamental components in wireless network management, providing both identification and control over various wireless segments within a larger network environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218494, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 229, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
