It is used to distinguish individual wireless networks that are managed and monitored within the system's infrastructure. This identifier ensures precise referencing and management of each network, facilitating tasks such as configuration, troubleshooting, and monitoring. The \"NETWORK ID\" applies to all wireless networks managed within the system, providing a consistent and reliable means of identification. By assigning a distinct \"NETWORK ID\" to each network, the system can efficiently organize and oversee multiple wireless networks, ensuring accurate tracking and management of network resources. Overall, the \"NETWORK ID\" is a critical component in the system's architecture, enabling effective management and operation of wireless networks through unique and consistent identification.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218486, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 331, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
