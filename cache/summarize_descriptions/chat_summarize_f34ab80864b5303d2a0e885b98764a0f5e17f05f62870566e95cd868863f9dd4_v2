It functions primarily by scanning and monitoring wireless environments to identify and mitigate potential security threats. One of its key roles is detecting and preventing rogue access points and unauthorized devices that may attempt to connect to the network, thereby safeguarding the network from malicious or unintended intrusions. Additionally, Air Marshal is employed as a security rule set within wireless networks to monitor client connections actively, ensuring that only authorized devices are permitted access. By continuously overseeing the wireless spectrum, Air Marshal helps network administrators maintain a secure and controlled wireless environment, preventing the presence of rogue devices and unauthorized access points that could compromise network integrity. Overall, Air Marshal serves as an essential security measure for wireless networks, combining detection, prevention, and monitoring functionalities to protect against various wireless security threats.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218479, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
