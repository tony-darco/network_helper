Specifically, RXSOP refers to the RX-SOP (Receive Signal Operating Power) level setting, which is used to fine-tune the sensitivity of the radio receiver. This setting is crucial for optimizing wireless performance, particularly in environments where precise control over signal detection and noise management is required.\n\nThe RXSOP level is adjustable within a range of -65 dBm to -95 dBm. This range allows network administrators or technicians to set the sensitivity threshold according to the specific requirements of their deployment environment. A lower (more negative) value, such as -95 dBm, indicates a higher sensitivity, enabling the device to detect weaker signals. Conversely, a higher (less negative) value, such as -65 dBm, reduces sensitivity, which can help mitigate interference and improve overall network stability in crowded or noisy environments.\n\nIt is strongly recommended that the RXSOP level be configured with expert advice or consultation, as improper settings can lead to suboptimal performance. For instance, setting the sensitivity too high may result in increased noise and interference, while setting it too low might cause the device to miss weaker signals, leading to connectivity issues.\n\nThe RXSOP setting is particularly relevant for the 5GHz band, where precise sensitivity control can significantly impact network throughput, reliability, and interference management. Proper configuration of RXSOP ensures that the wireless device can effectively balance signal detection with noise suppression, thereby enhancing overall network performance.\n\nIn summary, RXSOP is a configurable parameter that controls the radio sensitivity for wireless devices, especially in the 5GHz band, within a range of -65 to -95 dBm. It is a critical setting for advanced wireless tuning, requiring expert knowledge for optimal configuration to ensure robust and efficient wireless communication.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215442, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 368, "prompt_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 607, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
