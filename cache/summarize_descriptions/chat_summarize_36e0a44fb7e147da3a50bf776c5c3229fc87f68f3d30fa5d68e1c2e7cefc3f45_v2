It is used to distinguish one wireless network from others in the environment, enabling precise monitoring, analysis, and management. This identifier is essential for referencing a particular network configuration, facilitating the retrieval of connection and latency data, and ensuring accurate tracking of network performance. The \"NETWORK ID\" is integral to systems that monitor or analyze wireless networks, providing a consistent reference point for network configurations, performance metrics, and operational status. By uniquely identifying each wireless network, the \"NETWORK ID\" helps administrators and systems efficiently manage multiple networks, troubleshoot issues, and optimize network performance within complex infrastructures.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215437, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 137, "prompt_tokens": 209, "total_tokens": 346, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
