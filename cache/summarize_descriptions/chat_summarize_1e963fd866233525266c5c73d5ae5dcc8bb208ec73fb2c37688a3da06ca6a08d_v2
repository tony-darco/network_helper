It functions as a wireless network identifier that allows for tailored configuration to meet the needs of the office environment. The SSID supports configurable band settings, enabling network administrators to select appropriate frequency bands (such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) to optimize performance and coverage. Additionally, it offers steering options, which facilitate the management of client device connections by guiding devices to the most suitable access points or frequency bands, thereby enhancing network efficiency and user experience. Overall, SSID 0 serves as a dedicated and adaptable wireless network segment designed to provide reliable connectivity within the main office, with flexible options for band management and client steering to ensure optimal network performance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218488, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 171, "total_tokens": 329, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
