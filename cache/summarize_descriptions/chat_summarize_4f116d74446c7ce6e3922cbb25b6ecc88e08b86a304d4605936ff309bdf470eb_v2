This includes modes such as \"2.4ghz,\" \"5ghz,\" \"6ghz,\" \"dual,\" and \"multi.\" The \"BANDOPERATIONMODE\" specifies the mode of operation for the wireless band, determining which frequency bands are active and used for data transmission. For each SSID, it indicates the frequency band(s) employed, providing clarity on whether the network operates solely on a single band, such as \"2.4ghz,\" \"5ghz,\" or \"6ghz,\" or on multiple bands simultaneously, as in \"dual\" or \"multi\" modes. This information is essential for understanding the wireless network's configuration, performance characteristics, and compatibility, as different modes can influence coverage, speed, and interference management. Overall, \"BANDOPERATIONMODE\" encapsulates the operational settings that define how wireless devices connect to and communicate over the network, ensuring appropriate frequency band utilization for optimal network performance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218490, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 220, "prompt_tokens": 271, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
