Specifically, it is a timestamp formatted as a date-time string that indicates when the data collection or measurement interval concludes. This timestamp is used to mark the precise moment when data, such as CPU usage measurements, are considered complete and finalized. In the context of CPU usage monitoring, ENDTS signifies the exact time at which a data interval ends, serving as a crucial reference for analyzing system performance over specific periods. Overall, ENDTS functions as a key temporal marker that delineates the conclusion of data collection intervals, ensuring accurate and consistent tracking of system metrics within defined timeframes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215437, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 330, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
