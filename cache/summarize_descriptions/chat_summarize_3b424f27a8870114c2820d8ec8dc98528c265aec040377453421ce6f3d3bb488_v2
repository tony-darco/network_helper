It serves as a bridge between wireless clients and the wired network, enabling seamless wireless communication. The AP manages both upstream and downstream data packets, ensuring efficient data transfer between connected devices and the broader network infrastructure. \n\nThese devices are configured with various settings, including band selection, which can be set to either 'ssid' or 'ap'. This parameter is essential during the creation or setup of the device, as it determines how the AP manages wireless connections and interacts with other network components. \n\nAccess Points are hardware devices designed to provide wireless connectivity within a network environment. They are integral to expanding network coverage, supporting multiple client connections, and maintaining stable wireless communication.
