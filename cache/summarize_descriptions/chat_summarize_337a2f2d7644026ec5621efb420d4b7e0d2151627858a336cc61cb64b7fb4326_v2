It encompasses various configurations such as '2.4ghz', '5ghz', '6ghz', 'dual', or 'multi', which determine whether the SSID operates on a single frequency band or multiple bands simultaneously. This setting influences how the wireless device manages and utilizes different frequency bands, affecting network performance and compatibility. The mode specifies whether the SSID functions solely on one band, such as '2.4ghz' or '5ghz', or on multiple bands ('dual' or 'multi'), including the newer '6ghz' band. It also indicates how the device manages multiple frequency bands, either separately or concurrently, to optimize wireless communication within the network environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222325, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 682, "total_tokens": 853, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
