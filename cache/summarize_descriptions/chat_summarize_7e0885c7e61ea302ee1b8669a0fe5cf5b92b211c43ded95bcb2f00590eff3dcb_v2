It specifies the frequency bands used for wireless communication, which can include single-band modes such as \"2.4GHz,\" \"5GHz,\" or \"6GHz,\" as well as multi-band configurations like \"dual\" or \"multi.\" These modes define whether the wireless network operates on a single frequency band or multiple bands simultaneously, enabling devices to connect via the appropriate spectrum for optimal performance. \n\nThe \"BANDOPERATIONMODE\" setting also applies to the operation mode for individual SSIDs (Service Set Identifiers), indicating the specific frequency band(s) each SSID utilizes. For example, an SSID may be configured to operate solely on the 2.4GHz band, solely on the 5GHz band, or across multiple bands such as dual-band or tri-band configurations. This flexibility allows network administrators to optimize connectivity, reduce interference, and enhance network performance based on the deployment environment and device capabilities.\n\nIn summary, \"BANDOPERATIONMODE\" defines the overall and per-SSID operational modes for wireless bands, specifying whether the network uses a single frequency (2.4GHz, 5GHz, or 6GHz) or multiple frequencies simultaneously (\"dual\" or \"multi\"). It is a critical setting for managing how wireless devices connect to the network, ensuring compatibility, performance, and efficient spectrum utilization.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215448, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 290, "prompt_tokens": 271, "total_tokens": 561, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
