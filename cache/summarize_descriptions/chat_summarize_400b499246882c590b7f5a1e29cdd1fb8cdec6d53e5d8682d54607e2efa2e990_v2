It is a distinct frequency range that offers several advantages over the more commonly used 2.4 GHz band. Specifically, the 5GHz band provides higher data transfer speeds and experiences less interference from other electronic devices and networks, resulting in more reliable and faster wireless connections. \n\nThis frequency band is an integral part of wireless networking options, allowing for configurable parameters such as transmission power, bitrate, channels, and channel width. These configurations enable optimized performance tailored to specific network requirements. The 5GHz band is widely supported in modern wireless devices and is often chosen for high-bandwidth activities like streaming, gaming, and large data transfers due to its superior speed capabilities.\n\nIn summary, the 5GHz wireless frequency band is a crucial component of contemporary wireless communication systems, offering enhanced speed and reduced interference, thereby improving overall network performance. It is a standard feature in Wi-Fi operation and is configurable to suit various networking needs, making it a preferred choice for high-performance wireless connectivity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215444, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 239, "total_tokens": 455, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
