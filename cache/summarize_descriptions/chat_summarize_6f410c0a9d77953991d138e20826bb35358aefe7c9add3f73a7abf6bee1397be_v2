These configurations include a designated minimum bitrate, which sets the lowest data transfer rate permissible for devices connecting to this network, ensuring a baseline quality of service. Additionally, SSID 8 operates within a specified band operation mode, indicating whether it functions on a particular frequency band such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, or possibly both, depending on its configuration. The network's settings also encompass details about the supported bands, clarifying which frequency ranges are enabled for use. Furthermore, the configuration includes the status of band steering, a feature that manages client device connections by directing them to the most appropriate band to optimize network performance and load balancing. Overall, SSID 8's configuration parameters are tailored to ensure efficient wireless connectivity, balancing performance and compatibility through carefully set parameters such as minimum bitrate, band operation mode, supported bands, and band steering status.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215446, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 393, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
