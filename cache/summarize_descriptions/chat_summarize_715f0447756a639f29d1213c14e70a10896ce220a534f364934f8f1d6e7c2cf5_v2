Specifically, it includes the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz frequency bands. This information is typically found in various configuration contexts, such as device settings, network settings, and wireless configuration menus. The purpose of this array is to specify which of these frequency bands are currently enabled for use, allowing the device to operate across the selected bands for wireless communication. By consolidating data from multiple sources—device settings, network configurations, and wireless setup menus—it provides a comprehensive overview of the active frequency bands. This enables users and system administrators to understand and manage the device’s wireless capabilities effectively, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility with network requirements.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215445, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 342, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
