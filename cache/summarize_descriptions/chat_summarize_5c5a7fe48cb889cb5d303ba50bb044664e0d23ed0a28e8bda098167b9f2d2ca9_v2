It functions as a specific wireless network that can be customized to meet the organization's connectivity requirements. The configuration of SSID 2 includes various network parameters such as band settings, which determine whether the network operates on 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, or both, allowing for optimized performance and compatibility. Additionally, SSID 2 incorporates steering options, which facilitate the management of client device connections by guiding devices to the most appropriate access points or frequency bands, thereby enhancing network efficiency and user experience. Overall, SSID 2 is a tailored wireless network segment designed to provide reliable and configurable wireless connectivity within the main office environment, with settings that can be adjusted to optimize performance and network management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218488, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
