This setting allows users to select from several modes, including \"2.4ghz,\" \"5ghz,\" \"6ghz,\" \"dual,\" and \"multi.\" The \"2.4ghz\" mode enables operation on the 2.4 GHz band, which is commonly used for its longer range and compatibility with many devices. The \"5ghz\" mode activates the 5 GHz band, offering higher data rates and less interference, suitable for high-bandwidth applications. The \"6ghz\" mode, available in newer devices supporting Wi-Fi 6E, utilizes the 6 GHz band to provide additional spectrum for faster and more reliable wireless connections.\n\nThe \"dual\" mode combines two bands, typically 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, allowing devices to operate simultaneously on both frequencies, thereby optimizing network performance and coverage. The \"multi\" mode indicates support for multiple bands beyond the standard dual-band setup, potentially including 6 GHz, enabling more flexible and extensive wireless connectivity options.\n\nBy default, the \"BAND OPERATION MODE\" is set to \"dual,\" providing a balanced approach that leverages both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands for optimal performance and compatibility. This configuration ensures that devices can connect to the most suitable band based on their capabilities and network conditions, enhancing overall network efficiency and user experience.\n\nIn summary, the \"BAND OPERATION MODE\" is a crucial setting that defines how a wireless device manages its radio frequency bands, with options tailored to different networking needs and device capabilities. It offers flexibility to select specific bands or combined modes, with the default being \"dual\" to support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies for versatile and reliable wireless connectivity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215447, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 585, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
