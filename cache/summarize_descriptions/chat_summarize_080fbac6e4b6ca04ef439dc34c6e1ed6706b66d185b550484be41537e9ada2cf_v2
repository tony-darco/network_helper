These devices facilitate wireless connectivity for clients by creating wireless local area networks (WLANs), broadcasting Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs), and managing wireless connections. Access points are typically managed by wireless LAN controllers, which oversee their operation and configuration to ensure seamless network performance. They can be configured with specific management IP addresses and protocols to enable remote management, monitoring, and security enforcement. Overall, access points serve as essential components in modern wireless networks, providing reliable and scalable wireless connectivity to support various client devices and network services.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215435, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
