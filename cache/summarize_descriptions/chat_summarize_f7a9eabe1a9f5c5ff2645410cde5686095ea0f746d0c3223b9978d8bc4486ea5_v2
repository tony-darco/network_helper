It serves as an indicator of the starting point for fetching subsequent data pages in a paginated dataset. Specifically, \"STARTINGAFTER\" functions as a marker that allows clients to continue retrieving data from a specific position within a dataset, ensuring seamless and efficient navigation through large volumes of information. This token is essential in scenarios where data is returned in segments, enabling applications to request the next set of results starting immediately after the item identified by the \"STARTINGAFTER\" token. Overall, \"STARTINGAFTER\" plays a crucial role in managing paginated data retrieval, facilitating smooth, ordered access to extensive datasets in API interactions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218497, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 325, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
