Notably, it has a designated minimum bitrate, which ensures a baseline data transfer rate for connected devices, thereby maintaining network performance and stability. Additionally, the network operates in a specified band mode, which determines the frequency band (such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) used for wireless communication. These configurations are intended to optimize the network's performance, security, and compatibility with various client devices.
