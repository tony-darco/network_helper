It serves as a digital credential that verifies the identity of an entity, such as a person, organization, or device, ensuring that the communication or transaction is secure and trustworthy. Digital certificates are embedded within digital texts or data streams, indicating that the communication is secure and that the entity involved has been authenticated. These certificates are integral to various security protocols, such as SSL/TLS, where they facilitate encrypted connections and verify the authenticity of websites or services. Overall, a certificate functions as a vital security tool in digital environments, providing assurance of identity and enabling secure, encrypted exchanges of information.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218493, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 329, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
