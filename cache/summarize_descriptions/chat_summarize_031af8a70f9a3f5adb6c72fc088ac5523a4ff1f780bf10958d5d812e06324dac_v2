It typically includes essential parameters such as the Service Set Identifier (SSID), security mode, encryption type, and credentials necessary for authenticating and securing the connection. Additionally, a wireless profile may specify technical settings like the wireless channel, channel width, and transmission power, which help standardize device operation and optimize network performance. \n\nWireless profiles are utilized across different types of devices, including general wireless devices and specialized equipment such as security cameras. In the context of camera network connections, a wireless profile encompasses security settings and device associations, ensuring that cameras can securely connect to the network and communicate effectively with other devices or management systems. \n\nOverall, wireless profiles serve as a standardized template that simplifies the configuration process, enhances security, and ensures consistent operation of wireless devices within a network environment. They are essential for maintaining reliable, secure, and efficient wireless connectivity across various applications and device types.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215434, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 402, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
