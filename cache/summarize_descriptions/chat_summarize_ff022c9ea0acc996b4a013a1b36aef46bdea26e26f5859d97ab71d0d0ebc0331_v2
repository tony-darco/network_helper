These USB ports are integral components of network infrastructure, allowing for connectivity and device management. On access points, a USB port can be enabled or disabled based on network requirements, providing flexibility in device operation. When enabled, the USB port can be associated with a specific SSID, facilitating wireless connectivity and data transfer within the network. The attributes such as name help in identifying and managing individual USB ports across various devices. Overall, the USB port in this context serves as a versatile interface within network devices, supporting connectivity, device management, and network configuration, with its operational status and association with SSIDs being key parameters for network administrators.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215440, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 370, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
