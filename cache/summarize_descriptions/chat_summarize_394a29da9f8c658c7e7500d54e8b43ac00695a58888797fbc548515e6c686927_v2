In this mode, the device operates at Layer 2 of the OSI model, meaning it forwards traffic based on MAC addresses rather than IP addresses. Bridge mode is commonly used in various network setups to extend or connect different network segments seamlessly. When a device is set to bridge mode, it does not assign IP addresses to clients directly; instead, it allows traffic to pass through transparently, effectively integrating multiple network segments into a single, cohesive network. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where the device acts as a pass-through or intermediary, such as in modem-router configurations, where it bridges the connection between the internet service provider's network and the local network. Overall, bridge mode simplifies network topology by eliminating routing functions on the device, enabling it to serve as a transparent link that facilitates communication across different parts of a network.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218492, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 193, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 375, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
