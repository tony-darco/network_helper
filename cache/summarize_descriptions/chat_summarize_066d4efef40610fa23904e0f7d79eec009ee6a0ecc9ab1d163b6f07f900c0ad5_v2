These parameters serve the purpose of enabling targeted searches or analyses by specifying attributes such as the network client, device type, or SSID associated with the data. The descriptions indicate that each parameter is designed to facilitate precise filtering, allowing users to narrow down results to particular network elements or configurations. Additionally, there is a mention of a placeholder for a description type, which is not relevant to the core entity extraction but may serve as a template or structural element within the data framework.
