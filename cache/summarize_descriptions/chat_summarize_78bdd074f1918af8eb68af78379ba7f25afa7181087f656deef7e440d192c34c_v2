This network identifier, known as SSID 14, is configured with particular settings that include a designated minimum bitrate, ensuring a baseline data transfer rate for connected devices. The minimum bitrate setting helps maintain network performance and stability by preventing devices from connecting if they cannot meet the specified data rate threshold.\n\nAdditionally, SSID 14 operates within a defined band mode, which specifies the frequency band used for wireless communication. The band operation mode determines whether the network functions on the 2.4 GHz band, the 5 GHz band, or both, depending on the configuration. This setting influences the network's range, speed, and susceptibility to interference, thereby affecting overall network performance and coverage.\n\nThe profile of SSID 14 indicates that it is a carefully configured wireless network designed to meet specific performance and operational criteria. Its configurations, including the minimum bitrate and band operation mode, are tailored to optimize connectivity, ensure reliable data transmission, and accommodate the network's intended use case. These settings are crucial for maintaining a stable and efficient wireless environment, especially in environments where network performance and reliability are critical.\n\nIn summary, SSID 14 is a well-defined wireless network profile with particular configurations that include a minimum bitrate requirement and a specified band operation mode, ensuring optimized performance and stability for its users.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215447, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 274, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 495, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
