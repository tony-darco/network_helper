This network identifier, known as SSID 14, includes settings such as a designated minimum bitrate, which ensures a baseline data transmission rate for connected devices. Additionally, SSID 14 operates within a specified band operation mode, indicating the particular frequency band or mode it utilizes for wireless communication. These configurations are tailored to optimize network performance and stability, aligning with the intended use case or network environment. Overall, SSID 14 is a configured wireless network profile that incorporates essential parameters like minimum bitrate and band operation mode to facilitate reliable and efficient wireless connectivity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218489, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 327, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
