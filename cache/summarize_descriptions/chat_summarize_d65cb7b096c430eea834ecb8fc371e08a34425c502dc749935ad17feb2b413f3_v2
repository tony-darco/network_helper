It is an integer parameter used to control the sensitivity of the radio receiver, with a recommended configuration range between -65 dBm and -95 dBm. The RXSOP setting is crucial for optimizing wireless performance, as it determines how sensitive the radio is to incoming signals, thereby affecting the device's ability to detect and process weaker signals.\n\nSpecifically, RXSOP is used to fine-tune the radio sensitivity for the 5GHz band, which is common in modern wireless networks. Adjusting this parameter allows for improved network performance, coverage, and interference management. The setting is intended for advanced users or network administrators with expertise in wireless configurations, as improper adjustments can lead to suboptimal performance or connectivity issues.\n\nThe RXSOP level is configurable within the specified range, and it is recommended to seek expert advice when making changes to ensure optimal network operation. The setting essentially acts as a receive sensitivity threshold, with a typical value around -95 dBm representing high sensitivity, capable of detecting weaker signals, while a value closer to -65 dBm indicates lower sensitivity, which might be used to reduce interference or improve signal quality in certain environments.\n\nIn summary, RXSOP is a critical parameter for advanced wireless tuning, allowing precise control over radio sensitivity for the 5GHz band, with recommended configuration guidance provided by experts to achieve the best balance between coverage, performance, and interference mitigation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218486, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 302, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 580, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
