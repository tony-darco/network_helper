It specifies the period, measured in seconds, during which connection data is fetched and monitored. The timespan is an important parameter for understanding network performance and is used to evaluate latency trends over a defined interval. The maximum allowable duration for this data collection is seven days, ensuring that the analysis remains manageable and relevant for performance assessments. By defining the timespan, TIMESPAN helps in accurately capturing network behavior over a specified period, facilitating effective troubleshooting, capacity planning, and performance optimization.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215435, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 113, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 291, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
