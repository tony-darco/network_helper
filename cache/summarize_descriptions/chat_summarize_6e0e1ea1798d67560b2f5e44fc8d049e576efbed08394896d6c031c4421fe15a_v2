This setting controls the interval at which the splash page appears again for a user, based on the specified timeout period. Common options for the splash timeout include durations such as 30, 60, 120 minutes, among others. Essentially, after a user has viewed the splash page, the timeout period begins, and the splash page will not reappear until this period has elapsed. This configuration helps manage user experience by preventing the splash page from appearing too frequently while ensuring it reappears after the designated timeout period.
