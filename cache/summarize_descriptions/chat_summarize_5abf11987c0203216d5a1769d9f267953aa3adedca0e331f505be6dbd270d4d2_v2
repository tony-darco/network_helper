This band is a part of the overall band settings within wireless network profiles. Specifically, the 5 GHz band is enabled for the wireless network profile associated with SSID 14, indicating that this network utilizes the 5 GHz frequency to facilitate wireless communication. The 5 GHz band is known for offering higher data transfer speeds and reduced interference compared to the 2.4 GHz band, making it suitable for high-bandwidth applications and environments with many competing wireless signals. Overall, the 5 GHz band is an integral component of the network's configuration, enhancing performance and connectivity for devices connected to SSID 14.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215450, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 328, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
