It functions by broadcasting Service Set Identifiers (SSIDs) and managing wireless connections, thereby creating a wireless LAN environment. Access points are typically associated with wireless LAN controllers, which manage multiple access points within a network, ensuring centralized control, configuration, and security. These devices are characterized by unique serial numbers and are monitored for various operational metrics, including client activity and utilization levels. By facilitating wireless communication, access points serve as critical infrastructure components that extend network coverage, support mobility, and enable seamless wireless access for users and devices within the network environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218479, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 354, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
