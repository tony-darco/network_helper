In the context of network setup and management, wireless involves the configuration and creation of wireless RF profiles, such as SSID 14, which are essential for establishing and maintaining wireless connectivity. Ongoing wireless network activity includes performance monitoring, where network administrators continuously analyze the network's operational status to ensure optimal performance and reliability. This monitoring involves scanning and analyzing wireless signals to detect potential issues, optimize signal strength, and improve overall network efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, wireless network monitoring encompasses security-related activities, such as threat detection and security monitoring, to safeguard the network against unauthorized access, vulnerabilities, and malicious activities. These security measures are vital for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of wireless communications within the network infrastructure. Overall, wireless technology in this context is integral to providing seamless, secure, and efficient wireless communication, supporting various devices and applications within Meraki's network solutions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215438, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 436, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
