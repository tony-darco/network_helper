This mode indicates that a device supports both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi bands concurrently, allowing for improved network performance and flexibility. By operating across these two frequency bands simultaneously, DUAL mode facilitates better bandwidth management, reduced interference, and enhanced connectivity experiences for users. It is commonly implemented in modern wireless devices such as routers and access points to optimize network efficiency and provide seamless connectivity across different devices and applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218487, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
