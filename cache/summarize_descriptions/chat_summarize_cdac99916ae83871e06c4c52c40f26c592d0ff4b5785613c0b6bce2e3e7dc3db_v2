It oversees wireless network operations, including client connections, performance monitoring, and configuration management. The WLC provides centralized control over wireless LANs, enabling monitoring of network status, interface health, packet counts, and overall network performance. It supports high availability through failover mechanisms, such as Stateful Switchover (SSO), ensuring network redundancy and high reliability. The device tracks change history and status updates for wireless interfaces, identified by serial numbers, and monitors system metrics like CPU utilization, including per-core data and cloud ID filtering. It manages wireless network interfaces, handles data traffic, and maintains network configurations, firmware updates, and mobility MAC addresses. The WLC is frequently updated—typically every minute—to reflect current network conditions, facilitating efficient management of wireless access points, traffic flow, and network health within the organization.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222330, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 740, "total_tokens": 929, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
