This URL serves as the initial landing page, providing a branded or informational interface for users upon access. The primary purpose of the SPLASH URL is to redirect users after they log in or connect to the network, guiding them to a specific destination or content. It is often used for login purposes, allowing users to authenticate themselves before gaining full access, or for promotional content, such as advertisements, announcements, or branding messages. By configuring a custom SPLASH URL, network administrators can control the user experience, ensuring that users are directed to relevant or branded content immediately upon connection.
