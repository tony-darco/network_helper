It is characterized by attributes such as its name, MAC address, and, in some cases, IP address and serial number. These interfaces are responsible for transmitting and receiving data packets, with their activity monitored through traffic statistics including packet counts (total, received, sent) and packet rates (total, receive, send). They also have a history of status changes, which include timestamps, warnings, and errors, providing insight into their operational status over time.
