The network's configuration includes a defined minimum bitrate, ensuring that connected devices maintain a baseline data transfer rate for reliable communication. Additionally, SSID 10 operates within a specified band operation mode, which determines whether it functions on the 2.4 GHz band, the 5 GHz band, or both, depending on the network's design and requirements.\n\nThe configuration settings for SSID 10 also encompass details about the bands it utilizes, indicating whether it supports single-band or dual-band operation. This setup allows for flexibility in managing network traffic and optimizing coverage and speed. Furthermore, band steering status is a part of its configuration, which indicates whether the network actively manages client devices to connect to the most appropriate band, enhancing overall network efficiency and user experience.\n\nIn summary, SSID 10 is a carefully configured wireless network with specific parameters such as minimum bitrate, band operation mode, supported bands, and band steering status. These settings collectively ensure that the network provides reliable, efficient, and optimized wireless connectivity for its users.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218489, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 236, "total_tokens": 466, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
