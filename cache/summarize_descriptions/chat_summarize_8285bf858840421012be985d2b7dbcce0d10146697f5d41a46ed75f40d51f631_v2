It primarily refers to the specific radio frequency bands—namely 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz—that wireless devices utilize for data transmission. These frequency bands are fundamental in wireless network configurations and influence connection quality, speed, and overall network performance.\n\nIn network settings, \"band\" is used as a parameter to specify or filter wireless data. For example, it can be employed in API queries to filter wireless usage data by the selected frequency band, allowing for targeted analysis of network performance across different bands. The common bands used are 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz, each offering distinct advantages and characteristics. The 2.4 GHz band provides broader coverage but may be more susceptible to interference, while the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands offer higher speeds and less congestion but with reduced range.\n\nAdditionally, \"band\" is associated with network configuration options, such as setting minimum bitrate thresholds. In this context, the minimum bitrate can be specified either by the \"band\" or by the \"ssid\" (Service Set Identifier), with \"band\" being the default setting. This configuration helps optimize network performance by ensuring devices operate within desired bandwidth parameters based on their frequency band.\n\nOverall, the \"BAND\" entity is integral to wireless network management, enabling the specification, filtering, and optimization of wireless communication based on frequency ranges. It influences connection statistics, device performance, and network organization, making it a key component in both network setup and data analysis related to wireless communication.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215434, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 324, "prompt_tokens": 293, "total_tokens": 617, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
