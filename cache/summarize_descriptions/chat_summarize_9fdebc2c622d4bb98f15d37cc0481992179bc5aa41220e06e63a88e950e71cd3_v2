SSIDs are essential components of wireless networks, serving as unique identifiers for different wireless segments or access points within the broader network infrastructure. The network contains multiple SSID configurations, indicating that it supports several distinct wireless segments, each identified by its own SSID. This setup allows for the segmentation of wireless traffic, enhanced security, and the ability to provide different levels of access or services to various user groups or devices.
