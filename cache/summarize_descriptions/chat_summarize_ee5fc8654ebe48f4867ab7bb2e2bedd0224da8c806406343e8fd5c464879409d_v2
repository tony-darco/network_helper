It encompasses various settings tailored to specific network components and wireless devices. Specifically, it includes configuration profiles that define settings for network ports or USB ports, such as their names, default statuses, and associated port configurations. Additionally, it covers a set of radio frequency settings, including power levels, channel configurations, and band management, which are applied to wireless devices to optimize performance and connectivity. Furthermore, the wireless profile aspect of \"PROFILE\" involves configuring devices with specific SSID, security parameters, and identity settings to establish secure and reliable wireless connections. Overall, \"PROFILE\" serves as a comprehensive configuration template that ensures consistent and optimized network and wireless device operation across different environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222322, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 454, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
