It encompasses events related to a client's attempt to verify their identity and gain access to the network resources. Specifically, \"AUTH\" includes instances where a client has successfully authenticated, indicating that the client has successfully provided valid credentials and has been granted access to the network. Conversely, \"AUTH\" also covers authentication failures that occur during the client onboarding process, which indicate unsuccessful attempts to verify the client's identity, potentially due to incorrect credentials or other issues preventing access. Overall, \"AUTH\" reflects both successful and unsuccessful authentication events, serving as a key indicator of client access attempts and security validation within the network infrastructure.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218483, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 134, "prompt_tokens": 159, "total_tokens": 293, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
