The entity's configuration allows for adjustable power levels within a range of 2 to 30 dBm for both bands, with the default setting established at 30 dBm. This means that, by default, MAXPOWER is set to the highest permissible power level, but it can be customized based on specific requirements or regulatory constraints. The maximum power setting for each band is typically configured within the wireless profile, ensuring that the device operates at the desired transmission strength. Overall, MAXPOWER provides a flexible and standardized way to control the maximum transmission power for wireless communications on the 5GHz and 6GHz bands, optimizing performance and compliance with regional regulations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218486, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 368, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
