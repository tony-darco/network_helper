Specifically, it encompasses the list of enabled frequency bands—such as '2.4 GHz', '5 GHz', '6 GHz', or 'disabled'—that determine the operational spectrum for a given SSID. These settings control which frequency bands are active and available for wireless communication, thereby defining the coverage and performance characteristics of the network. The descriptions indicate that \"BANDS\" applies to all wireless bands across various SSIDs, including SSID 14, and are integral to managing the frequency coverage and operational spectrum of wireless networks. This configuration ensures that network administrators can enable or disable specific bands to optimize network performance, reduce interference, or comply with regulatory requirements.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222325, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 155, "prompt_tokens": 597, "total_tokens": 752, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
