It serves as a distinct wireless network name (SSID) that can be customized to meet specific connectivity requirements. The configuration options for SSID 2 include the ability to set and modify the network's band settings, allowing administrators to specify whether the network operates on a particular frequency band, such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, or to enable dual-band operation for broader compatibility and performance. Additionally, SSID 2 features steering options, which facilitate the management of client device connections by guiding devices to connect to the most appropriate or optimal band or access point, thereby enhancing network efficiency and user experience. Overall, SSID 2 provides a flexible and configurable wireless network setup, enabling tailored network performance and management through its adjustable band settings and steering capabilities.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215447, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 165, "total_tokens": 335, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
