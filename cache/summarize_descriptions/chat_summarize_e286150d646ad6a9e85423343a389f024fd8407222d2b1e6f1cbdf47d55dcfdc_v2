VPNs are configured with specific settings associated with a particular network or SSID (Service Set Identifier), ensuring that data transmitted between the client device and the network remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access. One key aspect of VPN configuration involves the client IP assignment mode, which determines how IP addresses are allocated to devices connecting through the VPN. This setup facilitates seamless and secure communication, allowing users to access network resources remotely while maintaining data integrity and privacy. Overall, VPNs serve as a vital tool for secure remote connectivity, leveraging specialized settings to ensure safe and reliable access to network environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218495, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 167, "total_tokens": 309, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
