It supports Wi-Fi 6E, an advanced standard that enhances wireless network performance by providing additional bandwidth and reducing congestion compared to previous Wi-Fi standards. The 6GHz band offers a broader spectrum, which allows for higher data transfer rates and improved network reliability. This frequency band is configurable within network settings, enabling users and network administrators to optimize wireless performance according to specific requirements. As a key component of modern wireless communication, the 6GHz band is integral to expanding Wi-Fi capabilities and supporting the increasing demand for faster, more reliable wireless connectivity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218487, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 318, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
