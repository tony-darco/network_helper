When this setting is enabled (true), it automatically directs clients to connect to the most open or optimal wireless band between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The primary purpose of this feature is to optimize client connections by balancing the load across both frequency bands, thereby enhancing overall network performance and reliability. \n\nThis setting is applicable on a per-SSID basis, allowing network administrators to enable or disable band steering for individual wireless networks as needed. When enabled, the feature intelligently guides clients to the less congested or more suitable band, improving connection quality and reducing interference. Conversely, if disabled (false), clients connect to bands without automatic guidance, which may lead to suboptimal distribution and potential network congestion.\n\nIn summary, BANDSTEERINGENABLED is a crucial configuration option that, when activated, helps ensure efficient utilization of wireless spectrum by steering clients to the most appropriate band, thereby optimizing network performance and user experience.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218488, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 210, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 452, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
