These frequency bands are fundamental to wireless technology, enabling devices to connect and communicate over different channels with varying characteristics such as range, speed, and interference levels. \n\nIn network configuration and management, \"BAND\" is used as a setting to specify the particular frequency band on which a wireless network operates. It can be configured to optimize performance based on the environment and device capabilities. For example, network administrators may set the minimum bitrate for a wireless connection, with options including \"band\" or \"ssid,\" where \"band\" defaults as the preferred setting. This configuration helps ensure that devices connect at appropriate speeds and maintain reliable communication.\n\nAdditionally, \"BAND\" functions as an API query parameter to filter wireless data, allowing users or systems to retrieve information specific to a certain frequency band. When querying wireless usage data, specifying the \"band\" parameter (with values such as \"2.4,\" \"5,\" or \"6\") enables targeted analysis of network performance, device distribution, or interference issues within a particular frequency range.\n\nOverall, \"BAND\" is a critical concept in wireless networking, encompassing both the physical frequency spectrum used for communication and the configuration parameters that control and filter wireless network behavior. It plays a vital role in optimizing network performance, managing device connections, and analyzing wireless network data across the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218483, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 316, "prompt_tokens": 256, "total_tokens": 572, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
