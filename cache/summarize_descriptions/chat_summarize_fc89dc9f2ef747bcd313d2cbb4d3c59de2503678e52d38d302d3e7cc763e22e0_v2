By applying AP TAG filters, users can narrow down the results to include only information associated with particular access points identified by their tags. This functionality allows for targeted analysis and management of network data, enabling administrators to focus on specific access points for troubleshooting, performance monitoring, or security purposes. The use of AP TAGs enhances the ability to organize and interpret network data efficiently by associating data filtering directly with designated access point identifiers. Overall, AP TAGs serve as a crucial tool for selectively filtering network data based on access point tags, facilitating more precise network management and analysis.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215454, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 166, "total_tokens": 299, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
