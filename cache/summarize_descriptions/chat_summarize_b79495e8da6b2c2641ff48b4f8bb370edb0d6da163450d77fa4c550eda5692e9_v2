For the 5GHz band, the available options include 'auto', '20 MHz', '40 MHz', and '80 MHz', with the default setting being 'auto'. This allows the device or network administrator to select an appropriate channel width based on network requirements, interference levels, and performance considerations. The 'auto' setting enables the system to automatically select the optimal channel width for the 5GHz band.\n\nFor the 6GHz band, the options include '0', '20 MHz', '40 MHz', '80 MHz', and '160 MHz', with the default also being 'auto'. The inclusion of '0' likely indicates an automatic or default setting similar to 'auto'. The wider channel widths, such as 160 MHz, are designed to support higher data throughput, which is particularly beneficial for high-bandwidth applications. The configuration of channel width can be set individually for each band within a network profile, allowing for tailored optimization based on specific deployment scenarios.\n\nOverall, the channel width setting is a critical parameter in wireless network configuration, influencing both the speed and stability of the connection. Proper selection of channel width can enhance network performance, reduce interference, and improve user experience across both the 5GHz and 6GHz bands.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218486, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 276, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 497, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
