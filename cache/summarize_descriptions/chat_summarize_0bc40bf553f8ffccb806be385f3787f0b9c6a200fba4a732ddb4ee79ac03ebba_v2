When AXENABLED is set to true, it signifies that the device or network profile supports and utilizes the 802.11ax standard, which offers improved speed, efficiency, and capacity compared to previous Wi-Fi standards. Conversely, if AXENABLED is set to false, the device does not support Wi-Fi 6, and the network operates without the benefits of this standard.\n\nIn addition to indicating the activation of Wi-Fi 6, AXENABLED is associated with a related setting that controls the 2.4GHz band radio. This setting determines whether the 2.4GHz frequency band is turned on or off. The default value for this radio is true, meaning the 2.4GHz band is enabled by default, allowing devices to connect over this frequency. When the 2.4GHz band is enabled, it can support legacy devices and provide better range, but it may be more susceptible to interference and congestion.\n\nFurthermore, it is recommended to disable band steering if the 2.4GHz band radio is turned off. Band steering is a feature that encourages dual-band capable devices to connect to the 5GHz band for faster performance and less interference. If the 2.4GHz band is disabled, disabling band steering prevents the network from attempting to steer devices to the 5GHz band, which may not be suitable for all devices or use cases.\n\nIn summary, AXENABLED is a key setting that indicates whether Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is enabled in a network profile. It is closely related to the status of the 2.4GHz band radio, which is enabled by default and can be turned off if desired. When the 2.4GHz band is disabled, it is advisable to disable band steering to ensure proper device connectivity and network performance. This comprehensive configuration allows network administrators to optimize wireless performance, compatibility, and coverage based on their specific requirements.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218486, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 413, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 609, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
