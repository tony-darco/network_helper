These APIs support parameters such as organization ID, network ID, device serial numbers, time intervals, timespans, VLANs, SSIDs, AP tags, and pagination tokens to enable detailed and customizable data access. Specifically, they provide functionalities to obtain wireless client connection statistics, CPU utilization metrics of wireless LAN controllers, channel utilization data, and detailed information about wireless LAN controller interfaces, including their usage history and related metrics. Additionally, these APIs support tracking the change history of wireless LAN controllers, allowing network administrators to monitor configuration and status changes over specified periods. Collectively, the \"API_ENDPOINT\" services are integral to managing, analyzing, and optimizing wireless network performance and infrastructure within organizational environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222323, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 469, "total_tokens": 637, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
