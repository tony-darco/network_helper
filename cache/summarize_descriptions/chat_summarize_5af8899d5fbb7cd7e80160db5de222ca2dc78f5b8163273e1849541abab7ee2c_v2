This frequency band is one of the primary options available for wireless network connections, alongside other bands such as 2.4 GHz. The 5 GHz band is favored for its higher data transfer rates and reduced interference, making it suitable for high-speed internet activities and modern wireless devices. \n\nIn network settings, \"5\" often appears as a selectable wireless band option, allowing users to choose the 5 GHz frequency for their connections. Additionally, the term \"5\" can be used as a numerical value representing the percentage of band usage within a network context, indicating how much of the 5 GHz spectrum is currently being utilized. This helps network administrators monitor and manage bandwidth allocation effectively.\n\nOverall, \"5\" encapsulates the concept of the 5 GHz wireless band, highlighting its role in providing faster, less congested wireless connectivity, and its representation in network configurations and usage metrics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215447, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 199, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 387, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
