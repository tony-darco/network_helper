It functions as the name attribute for profiles and entities, requiring uniqueness to ensure precise identification within systems. Additionally, \"NAME\" is used as the name attribute for each SSID, where it specifies the network's label, thereby facilitating user recognition and network management. Furthermore, \"NAME\" appears as a parameter name in queries, with examples including 'clientId', 'deviceSerial', 'apTag', 'band', 'ssid', and 'accessCategory'. These parameters are utilized in data queries and configurations to reference specific devices, access points, network bands, or categories, enabling accurate data retrieval and system operations. Overall, \"NAME\" is a fundamental attribute that uniquely identifies profiles, network labels, and query parameters across different applications, ensuring clarity and consistency in network and system management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215441, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 367, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
