Specifically, STARTTS refers to the start time of a query range or data collection interval, typically represented as a date-time string. It indicates the precise moment when data gathering begins, whether for general data analysis or specific metrics such as CPU usage measurement. In the context of CPU monitoring, STARTTS marks the timestamp at which the data interval for CPU usage measurement commences. Overall, STARTTS serves as a key reference point for when data collection or measurement activities are initiated, ensuring accurate timing and synchronization across various data collection processes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215438, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 319, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
