This band is part of the standard set of wireless frequency bands used to facilitate wireless communication. Specifically, the 2.4 GHz band is enabled within the network profile associated with SSID 14, indicating that this frequency is active and available for wireless communication in that particular network setup. The 2.4 GHz band is widely utilized due to its ability to provide reliable coverage over longer distances and through obstacles, making it a popular choice for various wireless devices and applications. In this context, the 2.4 GHz band is an integral component of the network's wireless configuration, ensuring connectivity and communication for devices operating within the network profile.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218488, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
