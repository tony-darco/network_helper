It specifies the length of time for which various types of network-related data are collected and examined. The timespan parameter can vary depending on the specific data type and analysis requirements. For network data fetching, the duration can extend up to 31 days, while for packet loss data, it typically ranges from as short as 5 minutes to as long as 90 days. In general data analysis contexts, the timespan is often less than or equal to 7 days, representing the total period of data collection and analysis. The default setting for the timespan parameter is usually 7 days, but it can be adjusted within the specified ranges to suit different monitoring or diagnostic needs. Overall, \"TIMESPAN\" is a flexible parameter that determines the temporal scope of network data collection, with typical durations spanning from minutes to several weeks, depending on the specific application.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218483, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 453, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
