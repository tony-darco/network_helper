These frequency bands are utilized for wireless communication and network segmentation, with the option to enable or disable them for particular SSIDs or networks. The term also encompasses filter parameters used in data queries to narrow results based on the selected frequency band, such as '2.4', '5', or '6'. It indicates the radio frequency employed by wireless devices, affecting network performance, radio sensitivity, and latency. Additionally, \"BAND\" specifies the operational mode of wireless bands, including configurations like '2.4ghz', '5ghz', '6ghz', or multi-band modes that manage multiple frequencies simultaneously or separately. It is used in utilization metrics, connection statistics, and performance analysis, allowing filtering of data related to specific frequency channels to assess latency, throughput, and overall network behavior.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222320, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 597, "total_tokens": 794, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
