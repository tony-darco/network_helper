For the 5GHz band, VALIDAUTOCHANNELS includes a range of channels such as 36, 40, 44, 48, and other channels within the bandâ€™s spectrum, along with a default list of channels that are typically used or recommended for automatic selection. Similarly, for the 6GHz band, the entity includes channels like 1, 5, 9, 13, and additional channels within the 6GHz spectrum, accompanied by a default list of valid channels suitable for automatic configuration.\n\nIn addition to these, VALIDAUTOCHANNELS also maintains a list of auto-selected channels that are considered valid for each band. For example, in the 2.4 GHz band, common auto-selected channels include 1, 6, and 11, which are widely recognized as optimal to minimize interference. These auto-selected channels are chosen based on their validity and suitability for automatic deployment, ensuring optimal performance and minimal interference in wireless networks.\n\nOverall, VALIDAUTOCHANNELS serves as a centralized reference for the valid, default, and auto-selected channels across the 2.4 GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz Wi-Fi bands. It provides essential information for configuring wireless networks, ensuring that devices operate on channels that are permissible, optimized, and less prone to interference, thereby enhancing network stability and performance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218486, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 302, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 544, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
