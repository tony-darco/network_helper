It indicates a configuration in which multiple bands are utilized concurrently, enhancing the flexibility and performance of wireless networks. Specifically, in the context of Wi-Fi, MULTI mode allows devices to operate across multiple frequency bands at the same time, thereby improving data throughput, reducing congestion, and providing a more reliable connection. This mode is particularly beneficial in environments with high device density or where high-speed data transfer is required, as it enables the network to leverage the advantages of multiple bands simultaneously. Overall, MULTI represents a versatile and efficient approach to wireless communication, optimizing network performance by supporting multiple frequency bands concurrently.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218488, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 310, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
