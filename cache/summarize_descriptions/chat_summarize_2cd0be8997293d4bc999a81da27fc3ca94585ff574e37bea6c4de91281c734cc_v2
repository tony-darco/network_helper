It is primarily employed in the context of beacon identification and management, particularly when operating in \"Non-unique\" mode. In this mode, the minor number functions as an integer value that differentiates individual beacons within a group, allowing for more precise identification of each device. The minor number is an essential component of beacon identifiers, providing finer granularity beyond the primary identifier (such as the UUID). It is used to distinguish between multiple beacons that share the same major number or group identifier, enabling applications and systems to recognize and interact with specific beacons within a network. Overall, the minor number is a crucial element in Bluetooth beacon configuration, facilitating detailed device management and targeted interactions within beacon groups.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215435, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
