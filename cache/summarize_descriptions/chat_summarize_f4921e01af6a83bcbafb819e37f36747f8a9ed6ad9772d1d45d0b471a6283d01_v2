When enabled, which is the default configuration, BAND STEERING actively encourages clients to connect to the most open or least congested band, typically steering devices from the 2.4 GHz band to the 5 GHz band to improve overall network efficiency and reduce interference. This feature helps ensure better bandwidth utilization, enhanced connection stability, and improved user experience by balancing the load across available bands. The setting can be toggled on or off, allowing network administrators to enable or disable client steering based on their specific network requirements. When disabled, clients connect to bands without any automatic guidance from the BAND STEERING feature. Overall, BAND STEERING plays a crucial role in managing wireless network traffic effectively by promoting optimal band utilization through its default enabled state.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218489, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
