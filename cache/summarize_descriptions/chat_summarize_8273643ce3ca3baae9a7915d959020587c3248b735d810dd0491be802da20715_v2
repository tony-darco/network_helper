These settings include a designated minimum bitrate, which determines the lowest data transfer rate acceptable for devices connecting to this network, ensuring a baseline quality of service. Additionally, SSID 9 operates in a specified band operation mode, which could involve dual-band functionality (such as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) or a single band, depending on its configuration. The network's configuration also encompasses details about the bands it supports, indicating whether it is set to operate on one or multiple frequency bands. Furthermore, band steering status is configured for SSID 9, which influences how client devices are directed to connect to either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz band, optimizing network performance and load balancing. Overall, SSID 9's configuration parameters are tailored to ensure efficient wireless connectivity, balancing performance, compatibility, and network management considerations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215447, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 390, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
