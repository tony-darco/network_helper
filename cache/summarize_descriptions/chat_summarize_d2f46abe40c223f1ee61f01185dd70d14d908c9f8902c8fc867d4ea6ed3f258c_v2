This entity includes detailed settings for optimizing and managing the operation of the 6 GHz frequency spectrum used for wireless communication. Specifically, SIXGHZSETTINGS covers a range of parameters such as power levels, channel configurations, and other operational parameters essential for the proper functioning of 6 GHz Wi-Fi networks. The settings include maximum power (maxPower) and minimum power (minPower) levels, which regulate the transmission strength to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and optimize network performance. Additionally, it specifies the minimum bitrate (minBitrate) to maintain quality of service and data throughput. The configuration also defines valid auto channels (validAutoChannels), which are the channels that can be automatically selected for operation, ensuring efficient spectrum utilization and minimal interference. Channel width (channelWidth) settings determine the bandwidth of the channels used, impacting data rates and network capacity. Furthermore, the settings include RXSOP (Receive Spatial Stream Optimization Protocol), which pertains to the optimization of spatial streams for improved reception quality and throughput. Overall, SIXGHZSETTINGS provides a comprehensive framework for configuring and managing the 6 GHz Wi-Fi band, ensuring that the network operates efficiently, reliably, and in accordance with regulatory requirements.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215442, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 262, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 462, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
