It is used to distinctly recognize individual network instances, whether they are wired or wireless. The \"NETWORK ID\" is essential for configuring, managing, and querying network settings, ensuring precise identification and control over each network. In the context of wireless networks, the \"NETWORK ID\" specifically refers to the identifier assigned to a particular wireless network, facilitating targeted management and monitoring.
