Specifically, it indicates whether ESL (Extended Service Layer) features are active for a device, thereby controlling its operational state. Additionally, \"ENABLED\" signifies whether a particular wireless band or setting is active or disabled, often represented as a boolean value or a list of enabled options. Furthermore, it also indicates whether the SSID (Service Set Identifier) is active and broadcasting, which directly affects its availability for client devices.
