This feature is designed to improve overall network efficiency by encouraging client devices to connect to the band that offers the best connectivity and least interference. The setting is applicable at both the individual device level and the organizational level, allowing for flexible configuration based on specific network policies or requirements.\n\nIn organizational contexts, the BAND STEERING feature can be enabled or disabled through a dedicated boolean setting. When enabled, the system actively guides clients to connect to the most open band, thereby enhancing network performance and reducing congestion on heavily used bands. The default state of this setting is true, meaning that, unless explicitly turned off, the system will automatically steer clients to the optimal band.\n\nThis feature is particularly useful in environments with dual-band or multi-band wireless networks, where balancing client connections across different frequency bands can significantly improve throughput, reduce latency, and enhance user experience. By steering clients to the most open band, organizations can better manage network resources, minimize interference, and ensure more reliable connectivity for all users.\n\nOverall, BAND STEERING is a crucial network optimization tool that, when enabled, helps maintain efficient wireless network operation by intelligently directing client devices to the most suitable frequency band, with the default configuration favoring its activation to maximize network performance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215448, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 276, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 460, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
