It is a critical parameter used to define the lowest acceptable data transfer rate for wireless connections across various frequency bands and SSIDs.\n\nSpecifically, MINBITRATE is used to set the minimum Mbps bitrate for SSIDs within indoor RF profiles, ensuring that the wireless network maintains a certain level of performance. This setting influences the connection quality and speed by preventing devices from connecting at data rates below the specified minimum.\n\nFor the 5GHz band, MINBITRATE can be configured with selectable options including 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps, with a default value of 12 Mbps. Similarly, for the 6GHz band, the available options are 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps, also defaulting to 12 Mbps. These settings allow network administrators to tailor the minimum data rate to meet specific performance and coverage requirements.\n\nAdditionally, MINBITRATE can be set individually for each SSID within a profile, with the setting indicating the lowest data transfer rate permitted for that particular SSID. This ensures that each wireless network maintains a baseline performance level, which can be crucial for managing network quality, especially in environments with diverse device capabilities or performance needs.\n\nOverall, MINBITRATE is a configurable parameter that plays a vital role in optimizing wireless network performance by establishing the minimum data rate threshold, thereby balancing connection stability, speed, and coverage across different frequency bands and SSIDs.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218486, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 338, "prompt_tokens": 330, "total_tokens": 668, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
