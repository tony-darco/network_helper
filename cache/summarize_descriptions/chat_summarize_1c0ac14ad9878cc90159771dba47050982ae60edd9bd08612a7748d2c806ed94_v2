It specifies the time interval in seconds for data reporting and retrieval, with common values including 300, 600, 1200, 3600, 14400, and 86400 seconds. This setting directly impacts the level of detail and resolution of historical network data, such as latency measurements, by determining how frequently data points are recorded and presented. For example, a resolution of 86400 seconds (1 day) results in coarser, less detailed historical data, while smaller intervals like 300 seconds provide more granular insights into network performance over time.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222324, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 352, "total_tokens": 487, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
