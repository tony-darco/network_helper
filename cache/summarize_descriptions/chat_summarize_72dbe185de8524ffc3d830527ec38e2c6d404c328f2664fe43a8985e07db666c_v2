These properties include \"name,\" \"id,\" \"groupPolicyId,\" \"passphrase,\" \"wifiPersonalNetworkId,\" \"email,\" and \"expiresAt.\" By establishing these fields, the schema facilitates the accurate and reliable transmission of information related to entities such as user profiles, network configurations, or policy details.
