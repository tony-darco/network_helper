It encompasses the primary frequency bands employed in wireless communication systems, notably the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands. These frequency bands are utilized to filter channel utilization data, allowing for targeted analysis of wireless network performance within each specific range. The 2.4 GHz band is commonly used for its longer range and better penetration through obstacles, while the 5 GHz band offers higher data rates and less interference, making it suitable for high-bandwidth applications. The 6 GHz band, introduced more recently, provides additional spectrum for Wi-Fi 6E and beyond, offering even greater capacity and reduced congestion. The \"BAND\" entity thus plays a crucial role in data filtering and analysis by specifying which wireless frequency range is being examined, ensuring accurate assessment of network utilization, performance, and interference within the designated spectrum.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215437, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 385, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
