It encompasses various modes such as \"Bridge mode,\" which allows clients to operate on the same subnet as the network; \"Ethernet over GRE,\" which encapsulates Ethernet frames over GRE tunnels for remote connectivity; \"Layer 3 roaming,\" enabling seamless IP address management as clients move across different network segments; \"NAT mode,\" where Network Address Translation is used to assign private IP addresses and manage traffic routing; \"Layer 3 roaming with a concentrator,\" which involves centralized management of IP addresses during client mobility; and \"VPN,\" which assigns IP addresses through virtual private network tunnels, ensuring secure remote access. These modes determine how network traffic is managed and routed, facilitating flexible and efficient client connectivity in various wireless and wired network environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222327, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 169, "prompt_tokens": 382, "total_tokens": 551, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
