These endpoints facilitate creating, updating, and retrieving a wide range of data related to wireless infrastructure, including Air Marshal rules, scan results, device configurations, and network performance metrics. They support numerous query parameters such as serial numbers, timespans, bands, SSIDs, VLANs, organization IDs, device serials, and pagination tokens to enable detailed filtering and data retrieval.\n\nSpecifically, these API endpoints provide access to wireless device data, Bluetooth settings, connection statistics, wireless profiles, and configurations. They also allow monitoring of wireless LAN controllers, including CPU usage, performance metrics, interface statuses, and historical data on controller layers and device interfaces. Additionally, they support retrieving event logs, connectivity events, latency data, network traffic, packet overviews, and network health metrics such as packet loss and channel utilization.\n\nSome endpoints are dedicated to managing network configurations, such as device type group policies, EAP override parameters for SSIDs, RF profiles, and Air Marshal settings. Others enable programmatic updates or retrievals of network attributes, device information, and wireless profiles. The endpoints also support detailed analysis of network latency, mesh statuses, client connection statistics, and network traffic, providing comprehensive tools for network oversight and troubleshooting.\n\nOverall, the \"API ENDPOINT\" serves as a critical interface for network administrators and management systems to monitor, configure, and optimize wireless networks efficiently, supporting both real-time data access and historical analysis across various network components and metrics.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222320, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 316, "prompt_tokens": 1154, "total_tokens": 1470, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
