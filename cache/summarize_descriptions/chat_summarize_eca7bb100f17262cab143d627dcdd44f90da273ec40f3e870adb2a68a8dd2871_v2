In this mode, NAT is employed to translate private IP addresses used within a local network to a public IP address for communication over external networks. This approach offers several advantages, including network address conservation by allowing multiple devices within a private network to share a single public IP address. Additionally, NAT mode enhances network security by masking internal IP addresses from external entities, thereby reducing the exposure of internal network details. Overall, NAT mode is a widely used IP assignment method that leverages NAT technology to optimize IP address utilization and improve security within network environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218492, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 308, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
