Specifically, the UUID serves as a distinctive identifier that allows devices to recognize and differentiate between various Bluetooth beacon networks or services. It is an essential component in beacon identification systems, ensuring that each network or service can be uniquely distinguished from others. Additionally, the UUID is employed to identify individual beacons within a network, facilitating precise management and interaction with specific beacons. By providing a unique and consistent identifier, the UUID enables reliable communication, tracking, and management of Bluetooth beacons across different applications and environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218483, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 317, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
