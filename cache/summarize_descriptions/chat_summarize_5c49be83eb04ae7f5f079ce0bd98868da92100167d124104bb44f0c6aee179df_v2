When this indicator is true, the SSID is broadcast on all access points, ensuring maximum coverage and accessibility throughout the network environment. Conversely, if the indicator is false, the SSID's broadcast is limited and controlled by availability tags, which restrict its visibility to specific access points. This setting allows network administrators to manage SSID coverage strategically, either providing broad access or segmenting network access based on organizational or security requirements.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222328, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 397, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
