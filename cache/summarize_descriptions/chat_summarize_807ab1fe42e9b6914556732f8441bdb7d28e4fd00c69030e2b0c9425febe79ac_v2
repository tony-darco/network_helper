It serves as a standard band for wireless local area network (WLAN) operations, enabling devices to connect and communicate over short to medium distances. The 2.4 GHz band supports various configurations, including adjustable power levels, data transmission rates (bitrate), and multiple channels, allowing for flexible network setup and optimization. This frequency band is integral to many wireless devices and network configurations, providing reliable connectivity in homes, offices, and public spaces. Its widespread adoption is due to its favorable balance between range and data throughput, making it a common choice for wireless communication systems. The 2.4 GHz band is part of the broader spectrum options available for wireless networking, and it is supported by numerous organizations involved in wireless standards and technology development.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215444, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 372, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
