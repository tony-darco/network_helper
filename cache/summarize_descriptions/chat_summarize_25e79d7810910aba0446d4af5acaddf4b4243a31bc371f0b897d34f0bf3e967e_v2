The network ID is a distinct code or label that allows for the precise recognition and differentiation of individual networks within a broader system. This unique identifier ensures that each wireless network can be distinctly recognized, managed, and accessed without confusion. The network ID plays a crucial role in network management, security, and connectivity, enabling devices and administrators to accurately locate, connect to, and configure specific wireless networks. In summary, the network ID is an essential element that uniquely identifies a particular wireless network configuration, facilitating effective network organization and operation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215454, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 162, "total_tokens": 284, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
