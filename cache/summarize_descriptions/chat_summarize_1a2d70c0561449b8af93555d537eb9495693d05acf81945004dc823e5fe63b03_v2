Each interface functions as a component of the controller, enabling it to oversee and coordinate various aspects of wireless network operations. The controller's primary role includes monitoring packet activity across its interfaces, allowing for efficient management and troubleshooting of the wireless network. By overseeing multiple interfaces, the Wireless LAN Controller ensures seamless connectivity, optimal performance, and centralized control over the wireless infrastructure. The interfaces serve as the points of connection through which the controller interacts with the wireless network, facilitating data transmission, network configuration, and monitoring activities. Overall, the Wireless LAN Controller, with its multiple interfaces, provides comprehensive management and oversight of wireless network traffic, ensuring reliable and secure wireless communication within the network environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218504, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 322, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
