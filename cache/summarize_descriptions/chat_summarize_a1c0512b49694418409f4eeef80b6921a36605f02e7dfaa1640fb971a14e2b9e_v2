Each port is characterized by configurable attributes that determine its operational parameters and connection settings. Specifically, a port object within a network profile includes attributes such as the port's name, number, enabled status, associated SSID, and pskGroupId. These attributes allow network administrators to manage and customize the behavior of each port, ensuring proper network segmentation, security, and access control. The port's name and number help identify and differentiate it within the network infrastructure, while the enabled status indicates whether the port is active or inactive. The SSID attribute links the port to a specific wireless network, and the pskGroupId associates it with a particular pre-shared key group for security purposes. Overall, ports serve as essential connection points on network access points, enabling flexible and secure network configurations through their configurable attributes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215440, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 185, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 371, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
