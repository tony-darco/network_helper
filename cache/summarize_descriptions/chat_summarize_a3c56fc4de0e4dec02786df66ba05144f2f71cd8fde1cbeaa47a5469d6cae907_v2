Specifically, a Walled Garden limits access to specific IP ranges and domains, ensuring that users can only reach designated sites or services before they have signed in or verified their identity. This setup is often employed to enhance security, manage network traffic, or provide a curated browsing experience by preventing access to unauthorized or potentially harmful content until proper authentication is completed. In summary, within a network, a Walled Garden acts as a protective barrier that restricts user access to predefined IP addresses and domains until the user successfully authenticates, thereby maintaining control over the network environment and safeguarding resources.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218502, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 146, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 321, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
