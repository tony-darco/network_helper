Specifically, an AP PORT PROFILE includes detailed configurations for the network ports associated with an access point, such as the port's name, enabled or disabled status, the SSID (Service Set Identifier) it is associated with, and the PSK (Pre-Shared Key) group used for security purposes. These profiles ensure that the access points are configured consistently and securely across the network, facilitating proper connectivity and security management. By specifying port settings, the AP PORT PROFILE helps in managing how wireless devices connect to the network, ensuring that the access points operate with the desired security protocols and network parameters. Overall, the AP PORT PROFILE is a crucial component in the deployment and management of wireless access points, providing a structured way to configure port-related settings to optimize network performance and security.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218486, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 185, "total_tokens": 364, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
