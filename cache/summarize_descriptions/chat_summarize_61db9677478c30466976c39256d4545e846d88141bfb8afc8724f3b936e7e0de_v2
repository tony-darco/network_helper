When this setting is enabled (true), it allows the network to automatically direct clients to the most open or optimal wireless band between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. This functionality helps optimize client connections by balancing the load across both frequency bands, thereby improving overall network performance and user experience. The setting can be configured on a per-SSID basis, providing flexibility to enable or disable band steering for different segments of the network. In summary, BANDSTEERINGENABLED is a crucial feature that, when enabled, facilitates intelligent client distribution across the available wireless bands, ensuring efficient utilization of network resources and enhanced connectivity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215445, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 392, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
