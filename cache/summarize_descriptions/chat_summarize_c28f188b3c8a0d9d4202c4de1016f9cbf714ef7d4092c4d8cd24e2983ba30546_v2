These bands include commonly used frequencies such as 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz, as well as the option to disable specific bands when necessary. The configurations encompass a comprehensive array of settings that determine which bands are active or inactive within the network.\n\nSpecifically, \"BANDS\" encompasses the array of wireless frequency bands utilized for flexible radio configurations in APs, allowing network administrators to enable or disable specific bands based on network requirements. The settings related to \"BANDS\" include the configuration of each SSID, where administrators can specify which bands are enabled—such as \"2.4\", \"5\", \"6\"—or disable them entirely. These configurations ensure optimal performance, interference management, and compatibility across different devices and environments.\n\nFurthermore, \"BANDS\" also refers to the overall organization of wireless frequency groups within the network, providing a structured approach to managing multiple bands simultaneously. This includes settings that apply to all Wi-Fi bands collectively, allowing for centralized control over which frequencies are active or disabled across the entire network infrastructure.\n\nIn summary, \"BANDS\" is a comprehensive term representing the collection of wireless frequency groups used in network settings. It includes detailed configurations for individual SSIDs, enabling or disabling specific bands, and overarching settings that govern all wireless frequencies within the network. These configurations are essential for optimizing wireless performance, ensuring compatibility, and providing flexible management of wireless radio frequencies across the network environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215445, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 319, "prompt_tokens": 397, "total_tokens": 716, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
