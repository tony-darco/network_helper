It ensures proper device recognition and distinguishes individual beacons within a network. Specifically, in Bluetooth configurations, UUIDs are employed to identify and differentiate beacons or devices, facilitating accurate communication and management. In Meraki's BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) configuration, UUIDs serve to uniquely identify networks or services, enabling precise targeting and interaction within Bluetooth-enabled environments. Overall, the UUID plays a crucial role in beacon identification by providing a unique identifier that helps distinguish different beacons, networks, or services, ensuring reliable and organized Bluetooth device management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215435, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 134, "prompt_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 379, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
