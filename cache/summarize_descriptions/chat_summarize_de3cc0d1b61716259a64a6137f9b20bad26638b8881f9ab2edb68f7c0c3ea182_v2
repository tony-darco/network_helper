These bands encompass the primary wireless frequency ranges, including 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz, as well as the option to disable certain bands when necessary. Each band is characterized by its status—either enabled or disabled—allowing network administrators to tailor wireless connectivity based on specific requirements and environmental considerations.\n\nIn the context of network settings, \"BANDS\" serve as a fundamental component for managing wireless communication. They are represented as objects or lists that specify which frequency bands are active, such as \"2.4\", \"5\", and \"6\", or marked as \"disabled\" if not in use. This configuration applies broadly across all Wi-Fi bands within the network, influencing the overall wireless performance and compatibility.\n\nThe configuration of bands extends to individual SSIDs (Service Set Identifiers), where specific band settings determine which frequencies are available for each wireless network segment. These settings ensure that only the desired bands are active for particular SSIDs, optimizing network performance, reducing interference, and supporting device compatibility.\n\nOverall, \"BANDS\" encapsulate the settings related to all wireless frequency groups used in network infrastructure, providing a flexible and comprehensive framework for enabling or disabling specific bands. This allows for precise control over wireless spectrum utilization, ensuring efficient and secure wireless connectivity across the network environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218488, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 293, "prompt_tokens": 355, "total_tokens": 648, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
