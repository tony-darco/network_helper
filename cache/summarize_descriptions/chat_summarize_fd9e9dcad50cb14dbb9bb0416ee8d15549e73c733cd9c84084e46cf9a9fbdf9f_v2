This configuration encompasses various aspects such as the operation mode, which determines how the access point functions across different frequency bands, and the enabled bands, specifying which frequency bands are active for use. Additionally, it includes band steering options, which are mechanisms designed to optimize client device connections by guiding them to the most appropriate frequency band, thereby enhancing network performance and efficiency. Overall, the \"AP BAND SETTINGS\" serve as a comprehensive framework for controlling and optimizing the wireless operation of access points, ensuring effective management of band usage and improved network performance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218489, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 310, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
