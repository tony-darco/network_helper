This identifier is used by devices to recognize, identify, and connect to the specific wireless network. The SSID serves as a unique label that helps users distinguish between multiple networks in the vicinity, facilitating seamless wireless communication and connectivity. In addition to its primary function, the term \"SSID\" is associated with broader concepts such as \"GEO,\" \"ORGANIZATION,\" and \"STRING,\" which may relate to the geographical location, organizational context, or data type associated with the SSID. However, the core definition remains that an SSID is the network name that enables devices to locate and connect to a particular wireless network, ensuring proper network identification and access within wireless communication systems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215436, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 334, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
