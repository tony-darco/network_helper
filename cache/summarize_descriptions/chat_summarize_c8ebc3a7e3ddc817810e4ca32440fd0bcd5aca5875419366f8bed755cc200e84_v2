The network's configuration includes a designated name, \"SSID 6,\" and detailed settings such as the minimum bitrate, band operation mode, enabled frequency bands, and band steering status. The minimum bitrate setting ensures that devices connecting to SSID 6 meet a certain data transfer rate threshold, which helps maintain network quality and performance. The band operation mode specifies whether the network operates on a single band (such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) or utilizes dual-band functionality to support multiple frequency bands simultaneously, enhancing connectivity options and network efficiency. The enabled bands indicate which frequency ranges are active for this SSID, allowing devices to connect via the most suitable band based on their capabilities and network conditions. Additionally, band steering status refers to whether the network employs band steering technology, which intelligently directs devices to connect to the optimal band to improve overall network performance and reduce congestion. These configuration parameters collectively define the operational characteristics of SSID 6, ensuring it functions effectively within the wireless infrastructure. The settings are part of the broader network configuration, aimed at providing reliable, high-performance wireless connectivity for users and devices associated with SSID 6.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218489, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 247, "prompt_tokens": 254, "total_tokens": 501, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
