It encompasses successful client authentication processes, indicating instances where a client has successfully verified their identity and gained access to the network. These successful authentication events are critical for monitoring authorized access and ensuring network security. Additionally, the term \"AUTH\" also includes data related to failed authentication attempts, such as the number of unsuccessful login attempts for specific devices. For example, there is a record of failed authentication attempts for the device identified as Q234-ABCD-5678. Monitoring both successful and failed authentication events provides a comprehensive view of network access activity, helping to identify potential security threats, unauthorized access attempts, or issues with user credentials. Overall, \"AUTH\" serves as a key metric for assessing the security and integrity of network access, tracking both successful authentications and failed attempts to maintain a secure and well-monitored network environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215438, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
