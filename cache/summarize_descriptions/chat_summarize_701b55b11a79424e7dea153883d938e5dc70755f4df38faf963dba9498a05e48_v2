It is used for filtering connection and latency data, and encompasses details such as the network name, authentication mode (e.g., 802.1x-radius), encryption mode (e.g., WPA-EAP), and pre-shared key, which collectively determine the security and access parameters for wireless profiles. The SSID also includes configurable properties like minimum bitrate, band operation mode, enabled bands, and band steering status, reflecting different wireless network configurations. It is used to establish wireless connections for devices such as cameras and other networked equipment, ensuring proper authentication and security. Overall, the SSID functions as a crucial identifier for managing, configuring, and analyzing wireless networks within the environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222320, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 489, "total_tokens": 654, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
