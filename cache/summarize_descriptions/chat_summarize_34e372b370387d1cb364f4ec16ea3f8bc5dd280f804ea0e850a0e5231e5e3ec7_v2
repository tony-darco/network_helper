Specifically, MINPOWER sets the minimum power levels in decibels-milliwatts (dBm) for the 5GHz and 6GHz bands, with adjustable ranges from 2 dBm to 30 dBm. The default setting for both the 5GHz and 6GHz bands is 8 dBm, ensuring a baseline transmission power that balances coverage and interference considerations. Additionally, MINPOWER encompasses the configuration of minimum transmission power for other bands, such as the 2.4 GHz band, where the minimum power can be set individually (e.g., 5 dBm for 2.4 GHz) within the wireless profile. This allows for precise control over the minimum signal strength emitted by wireless devices, optimizing network performance, coverage, and compliance with regulatory standards. Overall, MINPOWER provides a flexible and configurable framework for setting the lower bounds of wireless transmission power across multiple frequency bands, ensuring consistent and reliable wireless communication tailored to specific deployment needs.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218486, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 218, "total_tokens": 431, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
