Specifically, for the 5GHz band, MINBITRATE can be configured with selectable options including 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps, with a default setting of 12 Mbps. Similarly, for the 6GHz band, the available options are the same—6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps—with a default of 12 Mbps. \n\nIn addition to band-wide settings, MINBITRATE can be configured for each SSID (Service Set Identifier), which represents individual wireless networks within the broader network infrastructure. The minimum bitrate for an SSID determines the lowest acceptable data transfer rate for devices connecting to that specific network, thereby influencing overall connection quality and speed. This setting ensures that devices do not fall below a certain data rate, maintaining a baseline performance level and preventing connections from degrading to very low speeds.\n\nOverall, MINBITRATE is a crucial parameter for network administrators aiming to balance connection stability and performance. By setting appropriate minimum data rates for both bands and individual SSIDs, they can optimize network reliability, reduce interference, and improve user experience, especially in environments with diverse device capabilities and varying signal conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215442, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 289, "prompt_tokens": 318, "total_tokens": 607, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
