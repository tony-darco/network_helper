It is broadcasted by wireless access points to enable devices to identify and connect to the specific network. The SSID functions as a network identifier, distinguishing one wireless network from another within a given environment or system. It can be associated with various network settings and configurations, including security parameters, splash page settings, outage schedules, and traffic shaping rules.\n\nIn practical applications, the SSID is used to manage and organize wireless networks within an organization. It allows network administrators to specify minimum bitrate options, which can be set either by the SSID itself or by the broader network band, with the default being the band. Band selection can be configured to either 'ssid' or 'ap' (access point), and this parameter is required during network creation. The SSID also plays a role in filtering results via API query parameters, such as filtering by SSID number.\n\nFurthermore, the SSID is integral to network security and management. It is associated with specific security settings, including EAP parameters, and can be part of allowlist entries identified by ID, name, and number. The SSID is also used in traffic management, where traffic shaping rules can be applied to specific wireless networks identified by their SSID. Additionally, outage schedules can be configured or listed for particular SSIDs, enabling controlled access during designated times.\n\nWithin device environments, the SSID helps distinguish different wireless networks, facilitating device connections and network management. It is also used in network splash page settings, which are often employed for user authentication or informational purposes when connecting to the network.\n\nOverall, the SSID is a critical identifier in wireless networking, representing the network name broadcasted by access points, used for device connection, network management, security configuration, and traffic control. It is a key element in organizing and maintaining wireless network infrastructure, ensuring that devices can reliably identify and connect to the correct network within complex organizational environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218479, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 406, "prompt_tokens": 711, "total_tokens": 1117, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
