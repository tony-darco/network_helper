Each SSID is configured with a comprehensive set of parameters tailored to specific network requirements, including but not limited to bandwidth limits, visibility, availability tags, DHCP enforcement, content filtering, DNS rewriting, speed burst capabilities, VLAN tagging, authentication modes, encryption standards, and device access policies. These configurations enable precise control over network behavior, security, and device management.\n\nFurthermore, SSIDs are characterized by technical attributes such as name, minimum bitrate, band operation mode (e.g., dual-band or single-band), enabled frequency bands, band steering status, channel selection, channel width, power settings, and broadcasting status. They may also incorporate hotspot settings, rules, and security configurations to optimize performance and security for various user groups or device types.\n\nOverall, SSIDs represent distinct wireless network segments or configurations—such as SSID 0 through SSID 15—each designed to meet specific operational, security, and community needs within the broader wireless network environment. These profiles facilitate organized management of wireless access points, device policies, and community connectivity, ensuring tailored and secure wireless communication across different network zones.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222321, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 933, "total_tokens": 1175, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
