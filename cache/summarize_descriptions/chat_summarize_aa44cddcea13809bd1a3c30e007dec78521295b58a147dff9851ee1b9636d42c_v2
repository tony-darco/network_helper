This method can be either \"Unique\" or \"Non-unique,\" which influences how beacon identifiers are managed across devices. When set to \"Unique,\" each beacon has distinct major and minor numbers, allowing precise identification and grouping of individual beacons. Conversely, the \"Non-unique\" mode allows multiple beacons to share the same major and minor numbers, which can be useful for grouping or categorizing beacons within a broader context. This assignment mode is crucial for organizing and managing Bluetooth beacon networks effectively, impacting how beacons are identified, grouped, and interacted with within wireless communication environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222323, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 301, "total_tokens": 446, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
