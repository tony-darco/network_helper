The network's configuration includes a defined minimum bitrate, ensuring that data transmission maintains a certain quality and speed threshold. Additionally, SSID 10 operates in a specified band operation mode, which determines whether it functions on a particular frequency band such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz, or possibly both if band steering is enabled. The configuration details also specify the bands that SSID 10 utilizes, providing clarity on its frequency range and compatibility with various client devices. Furthermore, the settings include the status of band steering, a feature that manages client device connections across multiple bands to optimize network load and performance. Overall, SSID 10's configuration parameters are tailored to ensure efficient wireless connectivity, balancing speed, coverage, and device management through carefully set parameters like minimum bitrate, band operation mode, supported bands, and band steering status.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215447, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 443, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
