It specifies the width of the wireless channel in megahertz (MHz), with options such as 'auto', 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz. These settings influence data transfer rates, throughput, and interference levels. A wider channel (e.g., 80 MHz or 160 MHz) generally allows for higher data rates but may increase interference, while narrower channels (e.g., 20 MHz) tend to be more resistant to interference but offer lower throughput. The configuration of channel width is crucial for optimizing wireless network performance and is adjustable based on network requirements and environmental conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222325, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 407, "total_tokens": 558, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
