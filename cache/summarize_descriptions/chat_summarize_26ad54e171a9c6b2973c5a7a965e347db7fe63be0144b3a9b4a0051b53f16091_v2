The configuration process includes defining security protocols such as EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) and EAPOL (EAP over LAN), which are essential for authenticating users and securing wireless communications. Additionally, wireless technology is managed by creating and applying configuration profiles that specify network preferences, security settings, and operational parameters. Port settings are also adjusted to ensure proper connectivity and data flow within the wireless network infrastructure. Overall, configuring wireless networks involves a combination of setting authentication protocols, establishing profiles, and adjusting port configurations to ensure secure, reliable, and efficient wireless communication.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218502, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 134, "prompt_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 306, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
