This profile includes essential network connection details such as the Service Set Identifier (SSID), security mode, and authentication credentials. Specifically, Wireless Profile A is configured with a unique SSID that identifies the wireless network it connects to, ensuring that devices utilizing this profile can reliably access the intended network. The profile also encompasses security settings, including the security mode and necessary credentials, to facilitate secure and authenticated connections. \n\nIn the context of camera configurations, Wireless Profile A is employed to set up the wireless settings for cameras, enabling them to connect seamlessly to the designated network. The profile ensures that the cameras are configured with the correct SSID and authentication details, maintaining secure communication channels and proper network access. Overall, Wireless Profile A serves as a comprehensive configuration template that standardizes wireless connectivity parameters for devices, particularly cameras, within the network infrastructure.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215436, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 215, "total_tokens": 404, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
