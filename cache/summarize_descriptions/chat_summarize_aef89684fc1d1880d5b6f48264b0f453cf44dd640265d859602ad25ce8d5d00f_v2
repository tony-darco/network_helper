The network's configuration includes a defined minimum bitrate, ensuring a baseline data transmission rate for connected devices, thereby maintaining network performance and stability. Additionally, SSID 13 operates within a specified band mode, which determines the frequency band (such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) used for wireless communication. These settings collectively optimize the network's performance, security, and compatibility with various client devices. The configuration details suggest that SSID 13 is tailored to meet particular operational requirements, ensuring reliable connectivity and efficient data transfer within its designated environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215447, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
