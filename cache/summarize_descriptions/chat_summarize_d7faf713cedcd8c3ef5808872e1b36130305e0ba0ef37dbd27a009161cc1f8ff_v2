It has a designated name, \"SSID 6,\" and operates within particular band settings, including enabled frequency bands and band operation mode. The configuration specifies the band operation mode, which determines how the network manages multiple frequency bands, and includes details about which bands are enabled for use. Additionally, SSID 6 has a defined minimum bitrate, ensuring a baseline data transfer rate for connected devices. The settings also encompass band steering status, indicating whether the network actively manages device connections across different bands to optimize performance. Overall, SSID 6's configuration encompasses its network name, operational band mode, enabled bands, minimum bitrate, and band steering status, all tailored to optimize wireless connectivity and performance within its network environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215446, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 252, "total_tokens": 408, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
