It is employed in firewall rules to specify which services or applications are affected, enabling the control and restriction of network traffic based on port numbers. Additionally, \"PORT\" is used in traffic shaping rules to identify and manage specific services or traffic types, ensuring optimal bandwidth allocation and network performance. Furthermore, certain well-known ports are designated for server communication, such as port 3268 for Active Directory services and port 3000 for RADIUS authentication. Overall, \"PORT\" plays a critical role in network management by facilitating traffic filtering, prioritization, and service identification across different network environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222328, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 134, "prompt_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
