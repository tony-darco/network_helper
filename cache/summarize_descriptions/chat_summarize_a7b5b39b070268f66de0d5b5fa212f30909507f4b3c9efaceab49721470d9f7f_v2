This data provides a comprehensive overview of network responsiveness by capturing various latency metrics. It includes detailed information grouped by individual clients, allowing for analysis of performance variations across different users or devices. The data encompasses raw latency distributions, which illustrate the spread and frequency of latency values, as well as average latency figures that offer a summarized view of typical network response times. By consolidating these metrics, LATENCY STATS enable network administrators and analysts to assess overall network performance, identify potential bottlenecks or issues affecting specific clients, and make informed decisions to optimize network efficiency and user experience.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215438, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 314, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
