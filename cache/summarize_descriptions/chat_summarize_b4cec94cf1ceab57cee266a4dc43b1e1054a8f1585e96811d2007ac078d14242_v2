It functions as a parameter that distinctly distinguishes one network from another, ensuring precise referencing and interaction within the system's architecture. In the context of API operations, \"NETWORKID\" is used as a path parameter, meaning it is embedded within the API endpoint URL to specify which particular network the request pertains to. This identifier is essential for retrieving, updating, or managing data related to a specific network, enabling accurate and efficient communication between the client and the server. Overall, \"NETWORKID\" is a critical component in the API system, providing a reliable means to identify and operate on individual networks within the broader system infrastructure.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218486, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 164, "total_tokens": 307, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
