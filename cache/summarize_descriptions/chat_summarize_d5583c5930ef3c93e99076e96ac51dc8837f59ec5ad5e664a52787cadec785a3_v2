Specifically, it encompasses instances where a client successfully associates with the network, which involves establishing a connection and includes the collection of connection details such as device information, signal strength, and authentication parameters. Additionally, \"ASSOC\" also covers scenarios where the association process fails, such as during the client onboarding process, indicating an unsuccessful attempt to connect to the wireless network. These association events are critical for monitoring network connectivity, diagnosing connection issues, and ensuring proper client onboarding procedures. Overall, \"ASSOC\" serves as a key indicator of client-network interactions, capturing both successful connections and failures during the association phase.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218483, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 139, "prompt_tokens": 165, "total_tokens": 304, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
