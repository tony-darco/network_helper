It serves as a marker that signifies the boundary up to which data has been retrieved in a paginated request. Specifically, \"ENDINGBEFORE\" functions as a token that allows clients to navigate through large datasets efficiently by marking the position before which data has been fetched, thereby enabling subsequent requests to continue from that point. This token is essential for managing paginated data, ensuring that clients can systematically access all available information without duplication or omission. In summary, \"ENDINGBEFORE\" is a crucial component in paginated API responses, providing a clear and consistent method to denote the endpoint of the current data batch and facilitating seamless data navigation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218497, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 148, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 324, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
