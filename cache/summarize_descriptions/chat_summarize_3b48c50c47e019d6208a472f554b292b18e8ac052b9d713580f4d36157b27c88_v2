It is characterized by its unique SSID name, \"SSID 7,\" which distinguishes it within the wireless network environment. The configuration of SSID 7 includes a defined minimum bitrate, ensuring a baseline data transfer rate for connected devices, thereby maintaining network performance standards. Additionally, SSID 7 operates in a specified band operation mode, which determines whether it functions on the 2.4 GHz band, the 5 GHz band, or both, depending on the network setup. The configuration may also include band steering capabilities, allowing the network to intelligently direct devices to the most appropriate frequency band for optimal performance and load balancing. These settings collectively ensure that SSID 7 provides a reliable and efficient wireless connection, tailored to meet specific network requirements and performance criteria.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215447, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 382, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
