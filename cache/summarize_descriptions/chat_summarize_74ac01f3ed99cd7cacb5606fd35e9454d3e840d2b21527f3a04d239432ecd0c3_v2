This includes the setup of network parameters such as IP modes, security protocols, and server settings, which are essential for the correct functioning of the network infrastructure. Additionally, configuration involves the process of setting or updating Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and EAP over LAN (EAPOL) parameters, which are critical for wireless network security and performance. Proper configuration of these parameters helps in establishing secure and reliable wireless connections, optimizing network performance, and maintaining the integrity of network communications.
