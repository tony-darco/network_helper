It serves multiple critical functions, including distinguishing and managing multiple networks, associating devices and ESL (Extended Service Layer) devices with specific network segments or groups, and facilitating network management tasks. The NETWORK ID is used in API calls and configuration settings to specify which network is being managed or queried, enabling precise targeting of policies, configurations, and data retrieval such as latency or utilization metrics. It also plays a key role in grouping devices, managing network policies, and ensuring accurate data association across different network segments within the organization. Overall, the NETWORK ID is essential for organizing, managing, and analyzing wireless networks effectively within a complex organizational environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222320, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 503, "total_tokens": 647, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
