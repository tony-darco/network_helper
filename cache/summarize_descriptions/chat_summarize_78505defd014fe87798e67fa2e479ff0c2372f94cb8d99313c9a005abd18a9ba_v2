Specifically, it provides information about controllers such as the Wireless LAN Controller, including CPU usage and performance metrics, which are essential for monitoring and managing network health. Additionally, the API endpoint fetches data concerning controllers, access points, client counts, and overall network status, enabling administrators to oversee the operational status and performance of the wireless infrastructure effectively. This integration facilitates real-time insights into network performance, device activity, and resource utilization, supporting efficient network management and troubleshooting within wireless communication environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222336, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 281, "total_tokens": 398, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
