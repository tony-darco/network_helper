Primarily, it functions as a JSON schema designed for data validation and structuring API responses, ensuring that data exchanged within the system adheres to predefined formats and types. This schema defines the data types and parameters used throughout the system, including fundamental elements such as boolean values and string filters, which facilitate consistent data handling and validation.\n\nFurthermore, the schema establishes the overall structure of API response objects, providing a standardized format for data interchange between different system components or external interfaces. It delineates the format of both API responses and requests, ensuring seamless communication and data integrity. In the context of network monitoring, the schema describes the structure and data types of the data collected and analyzed, enabling systematic organization and interpretation of network-related information.\n\nAdditionally, the schema specifies the structure of network configuration objects, detailing attributes such as profileId, name, ports, and usbPorts. These elements define how network configurations are represented within the system, allowing for precise management and modification of network settings. Overall, \"SCHEMA\" serves as a foundational blueprint that ensures data consistency, validation, and clarity across various system modules, including API communication, network monitoring, and configuration management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215438, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 258, "prompt_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 498, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
