It uniquely identifies a particular wireless network within a larger infrastructure, enabling administrators and systems to efficiently monitor, analyze, and manage the network's operations. The Network ID is used to distinguish one wireless network from others, facilitating targeted configuration, troubleshooting, and performance analysis.\n\nThis identifier is crucial for managing various aspects of the network, including configuration settings, connection data, and latency measurements. It allows for precise retrieval of connection and latency data associated with the specific network, supporting performance monitoring and optimization efforts. The Network ID also plays a vital role in applying rules and policies tailored to the individual network, ensuring proper management within complex network environments.\n\nIn summary, the Network ID is a fundamental, unique marker that encapsulates the identity of a specific wireless network within a broader system. It is used for management, configuration, monitoring, and analysis purposes, ensuring that each network can be efficiently operated and maintained within the larger network infrastructure.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218479, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 263, "total_tokens": 468, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
