It is associated with switch ports or interfaces, used to segment network traffic, and improve both security and performance. VLAN IDs, such as '10', are used for network segmentation and traffic management, allowing administrators to organize devices within the network effectively. These identifiers can serve as filters in connection statistics queries, enabling detailed analysis of latency and network performance per VLAN. VLANs facilitate network segmentation for security and performance purposes, assist in monitoring specific network segments, and are integral to configuring network devices for optimized traffic flow and security management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222320, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 460, "total_tokens": 592, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
