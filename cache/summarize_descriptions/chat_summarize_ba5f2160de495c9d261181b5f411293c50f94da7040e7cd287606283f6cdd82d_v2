It facilitates communication between devices during the authentication process, ensuring secure access to network resources. In wireless networks, EAPOL plays a crucial role in managing encryption keys, which are essential for establishing secure connections. The protocol includes configurable settings such as retries and timeout durations measured in milliseconds, allowing for reliable and efficient key management and authentication procedures. Overall, EAPOL is a fundamental component in network security, supporting secure device authentication and encryption key distribution across various network types.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218495, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 120, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 323, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
