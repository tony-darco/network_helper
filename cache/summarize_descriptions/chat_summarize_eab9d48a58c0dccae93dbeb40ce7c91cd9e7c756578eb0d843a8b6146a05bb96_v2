The \"ENCRYPTION MODE\" refers to the specific encryption protocol employed to secure wireless data transmitted within the network. The encryption mode directly impacts the security level of the wireless connection by determining how data is encrypted and protected from unauthorized access. Specifically, the encryption mode specifies the data security measures associated with the SSID, influencing the confidentiality and integrity of the wireless communication. Together, these elements define the security configuration of a wireless network, with the encryption mode playing a crucial role in safeguarding data transmitted over the SSID.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222334, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 266, "total_tokens": 394, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
