In the context of network performance, latency is typically expressed in milliseconds and is a critical metric for assessing the responsiveness and efficiency of a network. The term \"latency\" encompasses both wired and wireless networks, with particular emphasis on wireless environments where latency can significantly impact user experience. \n\nThe data provided indicates that latency is measured as the average value over a specified timespan, which can be segmented by various parameters such as band, SSID (Service Set Identifier), or VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network). These measurements help in understanding the performance characteristics of different segments of the network, allowing administrators to identify potential bottlenecks or areas requiring optimization. \n\nSpecifically, the average wireless latency is monitored over time to analyze network performance, providing insights into how quickly data packets are transmitted within wireless networks. This information is vital for diagnosing issues related to network responsiveness, especially in environments where real-time data transmission is critical, such as voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing, or online gaming. \n\nOverall, latency serves as a key indicator of network health, with lower latency values generally correlating with better performance and higher user satisfaction. By continuously measuring and analyzing average latency across various network segments and timeframes, network administrators can ensure optimal operation, troubleshoot issues effectively, and enhance the overall quality of service provided by the network infrastructure.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215441, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 293, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 468, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
