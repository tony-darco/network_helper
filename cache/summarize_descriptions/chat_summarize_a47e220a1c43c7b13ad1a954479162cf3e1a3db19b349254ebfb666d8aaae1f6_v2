It encompasses several key aspects: first, it involves assessing the average bandwidth usage across all frequency bands for a device, which provides an indication of the device's network performance. Second, it measures the extent to which the wireless channel's capacity is being utilized over time, serving as an indicator of network load and congestion levels. Third, it evaluates the percentage of channel bandwidth that is actively used in wireless networks, which is crucial for assessing overall network performance and identifying potential congestion issues. By analyzing channel utilization, network administrators can determine the efficiency of wireless communication, identify bottlenecks, and optimize network resources to improve performance and reduce interference. High channel utilization may suggest network congestion or overuse, while low utilization could indicate underused capacity or potential issues with network connectivity. Overall, channel utilization is a vital metric for maintaining optimal wireless network performance, ensuring efficient bandwidth distribution, and managing network traffic effectively.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218483, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 195, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
