It is a configuration option commonly found in wireless networking devices, indicating the device's capability to operate across multiple frequency bands concurrently. This mode enhances network performance by allowing devices to utilize various bands simultaneously, thereby increasing bandwidth, reducing congestion, and improving overall connectivity stability. In the context of Wi-Fi technology, MULTI refers to a mode that enables the use of multiple frequency bands, such as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, at the same time, facilitating better data throughput and more efficient spectrum utilization. This multi-band support is particularly beneficial in environments with high device density or where high-speed data transfer is required, as it allows for more flexible and efficient network management. Overall, MULTI signifies an advanced operational mode that leverages multiple frequency bands to optimize wireless communication performance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215445, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 363, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
