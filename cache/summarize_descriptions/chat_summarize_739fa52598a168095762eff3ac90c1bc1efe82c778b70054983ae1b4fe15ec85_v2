It functions as a distinct SSID (Service Set Identifier) that allows devices to connect to a particular wireless network within a broader network infrastructure. The configuration of SSID 5 includes several customizable properties, such as its name, which uniquely identifies the network to users and devices. Additionally, SSID 5 has defined operational parameters, including the band operation mode, which determines whether it operates on the 2.4 GHz band, the 5 GHz band, or both, depending on the network's configuration and capabilities. \n\nFurthermore, SSID 5 incorporates settings related to band steering, a feature that optimizes client device connections by directing them to the most appropriate frequency band for better performance and load balancing. The network configuration for SSID 5 also specifies minimum bitrate requirements, ensuring that connected devices meet certain performance standards for data transmission. These configurations collectively enable SSID 5 to provide a tailored wireless connectivity experience, balancing performance, compatibility, and network management considerations.\n\nOverall, SSID 5 is a configurable wireless network identifier designed to support specific operational parameters, including band operation mode, band steering, and minimum bitrate settings, facilitating efficient and reliable wireless connectivity within the network environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215446, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 251, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 449, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
