This profile encompasses various settings related to the network ports of an access point, including both physical and USB ports. Specifically, an AP port profile defines the configuration parameters for individual access point ports, such as port names, enabling or disabling the ports, and associated wireless network settings. These settings include the Service Set Identifier (SSID), which identifies the wireless network broadcasted by the access point, and the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) group IDs, which are used for securing wireless connections through encryption keys. \n\nThe profile ensures that each port on the access point is configured consistently and according to network security and operational requirements. By specifying whether a port is enabled or disabled, the profile controls access and connectivity. The inclusion of port names facilitates management and identification of specific ports within the network infrastructure. The SSID settings determine the wireless network's identity, while the PSK group IDs provide the necessary security parameters for client authentication and data encryption.\n\nIn summary, the \"AP PORT PROFILE\" is a critical configuration entity that standardizes and manages the settings for access point network ports, including port identification, operational status, wireless network identifiers, and security credentials. This ensures efficient, secure, and manageable deployment of wireless access points within a network environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215440, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 268, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 482, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
