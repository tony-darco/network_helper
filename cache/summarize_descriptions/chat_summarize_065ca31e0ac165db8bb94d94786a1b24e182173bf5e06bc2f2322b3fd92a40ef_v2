Additionally, \"CONFIGURE\" encompasses the creation and updating of RF (Radio Frequency) profiles, exemplified by tasks like managing the settings for SSID 14, which involves defining and modifying wireless network identifiers and their associated parameters. Furthermore, the term covers the setup and adjustment of network profiles and ports within both wireless and Ethernet systems, ensuring proper connectivity, security, and performance.
