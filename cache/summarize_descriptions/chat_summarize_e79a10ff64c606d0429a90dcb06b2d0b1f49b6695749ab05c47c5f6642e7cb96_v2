It functions as a distinct wireless network identifier, allowing for targeted configuration and management. The SSID supports configurable band settings, enabling network administrators to specify the frequency bands (such as 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) used by this particular network segment. Additionally, it offers steering options, which facilitate the management of client device connections by guiding devices to connect to the most appropriate band or access point, thereby optimizing network performance and reliability. Overall, SSID 1 serves as a dedicated wireless network within the main office environment, with customizable parameters to enhance connectivity, security, and user experience.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218488, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 171, "total_tokens": 314, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
