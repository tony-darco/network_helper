It functions as a separate SSID (Service Set Identifier) that allows devices to connect to a dedicated wireless network within the organization's infrastructure. The configuration of SSID 3 includes several key parameters designed to optimize network performance and security.\n\nNotably, SSID 3 has defined settings related to its network operation, such as a minimum bitrate requirement, which ensures that connected devices maintain a certain level of data transfer speed for reliable communication. Additionally, the SSID operates on specific frequency bands, with configurable band settings that determine whether it functions on 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, or both, depending on the network's needs and device compatibility.\n\nThe network configuration for SSID 3 also includes steering options, which are mechanisms to guide client devices to connect to the most appropriate band or access point, thereby enhancing overall network efficiency and user experience. These steering features help balance the load across different bands and access points, reducing congestion and improving connection stability.\n\nOverall, SSID 3 is a carefully configured wireless network segment tailored to meet the organization's performance and security requirements. Its settings, including band operation modes, minimum bitrate, and steering options, are designed to provide a reliable, efficient, and secure wireless connectivity experience within the main office environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218489, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 275, "prompt_tokens": 235, "total_tokens": 510, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
