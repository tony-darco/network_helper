The AP TAG is also employed to filter network data, such as latency and connection information, by specific access points or groups of access points, thereby aiding in network analysis and troubleshooting. Overall, the AP TAG serves as a crucial organizational tool that enhances network oversight and device management by providing a clear and systematic way to identify and filter access points within the network infrastructure.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756222320, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 361, "total_tokens": 484, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are an expert in wireless networking and network management.
