It serves as the primary means of identifying and differentiating one network from another within a given environment. Networks are identified by their Network IDs, which ensure that each wireless network can be individually distinguished, facilitating proper network management, configuration, and connectivity. The Network ID's role is crucial in establishing and maintaining the integrity of wireless network identification, as it uniquely associates with a particular network setup, preventing confusion or overlap with other networks. Overall, the Network ID is an essential attribute that uniquely identifies a specific wireless network configuration, enabling effective network organization and operation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218502, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 126, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 307, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
