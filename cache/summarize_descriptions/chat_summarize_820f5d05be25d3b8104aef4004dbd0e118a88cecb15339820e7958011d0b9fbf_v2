SSIDs serve as the network names that identify and distinguish individual wireless networks, allowing devices to connect to the appropriate network within a given environment. In the context of Meraki-managed wireless networks, SSIDs are specifically configured and managed through the Meraki platform, which provides centralized control and management of wireless network settings. This integration ensures that SSIDs are properly set up, maintained, and optimized for performance and security within the Meraki ecosystem. Overall, SSIDs are essential elements of wireless network configurations, and in Meraki-managed environments, they are an integral part of the network management process, facilitating seamless wireless connectivity and network organization.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756218504, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 167, "total_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
