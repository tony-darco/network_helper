It is primarily employed in the \"Non-unique\" mode of beacon operation, where it serves to differentiate groups of beacons within a larger network or deployment. The major number is typically an integer value that helps categorize and organize beacons by grouping them into distinct sets, facilitating easier management and identification. In practical terms, the major value is used in beacon identifiers to distinguish one group of beacons from another, enabling precise targeting and monitoring within complex deployments. This identifier is integral to the configuration process, allowing administrators to assign and recognize specific beacon groups based on their major number. Overall, the major number is a crucial component in Bluetooth beacon settings, providing a straightforward means to categorize beacons and streamline network management in environments where multiple beacons are deployed.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215434, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 393, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
