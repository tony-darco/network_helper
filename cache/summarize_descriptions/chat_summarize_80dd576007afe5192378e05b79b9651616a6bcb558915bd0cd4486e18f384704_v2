It functions as a distinct SSID (Service Set Identifier) that allows devices to connect to the wireless network. The configuration of SSID 3 includes parameters such as minimum bitrate requirements, which ensure a baseline data transfer rate for connected devices, and band operation modes, which determine whether the network operates on the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands, or both. These band settings are configurable, allowing network administrators to optimize performance and coverage based on their specific environment and requirements. Additionally, SSID 3 may include steering options, which facilitate the management of client device connections by guiding devices to the most appropriate band or access point to improve network efficiency and user experience. Overall, SSID 3 is a customizable wireless network identifier designed to support tailored network configurations, ensuring reliable connectivity and optimized performance within the network infrastructure.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1756215446, "model": "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4c155951e", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
