Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\ntext:\n18', '24', '36', '48' or '54'.\"\n                            ,\n                            \"bandOperationMode\": \n                              \"type\": \"string\",\n                              \"enum\": [\n                                \"2.4ghz\",\n                                \"5ghz\",\n                                \"6ghz\",\n                                \"dual\",\n                                \"multi\"\n                              ],\n                              \"description\": \"Choice between 'dual', '2.4ghz', '5ghz', '6ghz' or 'multi'.\"\n                            ,\n                            \"bands\": \n                              \"type\": \"object\",\n                              \"properties\": \n                                \"enabled\": \n                                  \"type\": \"array\",\n                                  \"items\": \n                                    \"type\": \"string\"\n                                  ,\n                                  \"description\": \"List of enabled bands.
